I have two dogs and the second one started this habit and taught it to our first dog.  So disgusting!  As suggested by others we doubled the dosage and so far (about six months plus) it's been working I would say about 90% of the time (that we can tell).My husband and I work long hours so they are in our side yard (about 15 x 45) for many hours by themselves with a door to the garage.  Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.  Just adding a bit of those to the top of his dry dog food really helps with his finishing his food.

She'd been living in multi-dog households (meaning four dogs or more) for her entire life. We just have one other dog, her brother. She immediately began ingesting feces from both her and her brother. I'm not sure if this is a habit from living with many other dogs or was brought on by the stress of being in a new home, but I was determined to stop it.We tried a product from Drs. Foster and Smith called Distaste and it worked quite well, but my male dog wasn't terribly thrilled with it-- it came in chew form and he didn't seem to like them. So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely. My only other comment is the smell of the product itself. It smells like Pixie Stick dust, or something similarly sweet/sour and I find the smell really awful.

I bought it at Lowe's for about the same price on Amazon a few weeks ago.  A couple problems: the hook at the top slides around the short section of wire on the cage that it hooks on (maybe an inch total).  Just means that it doesn't sit perfectly level.  The problem with that is that the birds don't like sitting on the downward-sloping part, so they only use the upward sloping part.  I'm going to try modding it so the hook isn't detachable and doesn't slide, but just stays in the middle so it's level.  The other issue is that the birds don't like sitting on the front/back of the suet cage, I think because it moves around a lot when they land, but every time they try it, there's a lot of wing flapping for a few seconds before they give up and use the other feeder.  This might get better with time.  If it does, I will update this review.  For now, I would say it's so-so for a suet feeder.  I've been looking at nicer more expensive ones, but I'll give this another month (and update this review!)UPDATE: The feeder made it through the season, but I don't think I'd buy again.  Not even sure if I'll put it out next year.  I have another feeder that has space for suet on each side.  That suet gets eaten REALLY quickly, while the one in the cage lasts long enough to start molding (several weeks).

When I'm cleaning it they pace around me like a child waiting for their teddy bear to come out of the wash. When I had one cat the bin needed to be emptied once a week. Now with 2 it's more like every 3 days. I line the bin with a little trash bag and it works great. No need to buy the expensive receptacles. Every so often I'll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some \"left over\" off the rake. It does make a noise but it's not that loud. I recommend leaving it in a closet or laundry room. Guests always ask why my boiler room is making noise. The noise doesn't bother my cats, they actually come running to watch it work. It is, however, the only litter box they've ever known.The Catch: I bought the box in April and had no problems until late October when I realized the box was getting very full. The censors had stopped working. I called their customer service, who's pre-recorded message makes you think you've called the wrong number (they start talking about tools), and spoke with some friendly but not 100% knowledgeable people. They gave me all kinds of instructions on how to fix it myself like dusting off the censors, \"re-setting\" the box by clicking the switches 10 times each, etc. All of these things I tried as they are in the instructions but I humored them. Finally they gave me instructions on how to get a new box so now I'm in the process of mailing the wire that powers the rake, the battery compartment cover, my receipt, and $10 so I can get a new one. I'm not too happy that I had to destroy my box with no guarantee they will send me a new one but I understand why they make you do it.The Moral of the Story: Nothing makes a cat happier than a clean littler box and now that it's broken I simply can't keep it clean enough for them (in their opinions). I'm going to get the replacement and use it until it breaks too but I think I'm going to look into the toilet training kit.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Love - Hate relationship", "unixReviewTime": 1164067200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2006"}
{"reviewerID": "A1QCJOGQL05KRI", "asin": "B00005MF9T", "reviewerName": "Jaw", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I gave 5 stars because i've had three Litter Maids over about 12-13 years and have always been very grateful not to have to clean the catbox--i was able to forget about it for at least a couple of weeks at a time, sometimes much more. I have only one small cat.  You can't beat not having to think about the catbox, it's almost like not having one at all--compared to the old fashion litter box.I first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995, there was a full page ad, and you could pay in three installments, it was expensive, at least a couple hundred.  Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one.  Mine worked right out of the box.it's always tricky putting the right amount of litter in.  If i put too much, it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out.  Following the instructions, i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction, but if i put it lower than the limit line, it would be fine.I had some kind of technical problem in the beginning, i can't remember what, and was pleased with their tech support, they took care of me, way back then.After a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.  That was yet another technical advance for my situation.  The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box, and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.In the beginning, Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls. Then, my pet store came out with \"lite tracking litter pearls\" which were not round. They made them irregular shaped and rough, to prevent tracking i guess. That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid.  It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism.  My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls, so i had to search for an alternative.The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn't find the product on the web though.As long as i had the little round ball litter, not the lite tracking kind, my Litter Maid performed consistently.  The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem.  Long ago, i got the tent. I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid.  For me, the less evidence of a litter box the better.The Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box, eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them, so i decided rather than clean it, i'd just get a new one.  the motor was still working fine, there was no problem with it after several years. I just didn't feel like cleaning it, was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one. I've had the third one for several more years, it has been very low maintenance, no mechanical problems, i just have cleaned it every few weeks, i'm not sure how often, maybe 2 weeks, maybe more, it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.Recently it stopped working.  The light was on but without warning, it wouldn't become active, it just sat there.I got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I'm still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.The Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot, less struggle, less time spent bending over the \"dreaded area.\"  And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.Being inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn't have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn't have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.Oh, i almost forgot. My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid, so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container, causing it to fill up faster, only on that side, than it would if it had been distributed evenly.  When it fills up and doesn't close completely, that's when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container, but i alway would find that half the container wasn't used, it was empty on one side, full on the other. This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.Update:  10/3/10I have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago.  I was having a very hard time with it.  It worked well as far as the motor and everything it's supposed to do, but the problem  was with the litter (crystals). The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i didn't change the litter, my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid.  That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage, by my standards.  Urine was getting all over the box and under the box. I thought the litter maid was leaking but couldn't find any openings.  It took me a long time to figure out that my cat's hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate.  When i realized it, about two months ago, i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away. but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid, i think it must've developed an odor because of all the urine all over it, i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i'm sure.  Even though the crystals weren't saturated at all, she was peeing on the floor cover.  So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box. So far it's working great. I took the Litter Maid outside, cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray, it looks ok, i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage.  It has been working very well.  A real trooper.I want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid, it served me well for about 16 or more years, about 5 of them over those years, two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well. I never had a problem with the motors, and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over, never giving out.This is different from some peoples' experience.  I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid, not clay or clumping litter, and that may be why i haven't had the same problems some have had.  I would recommend using crystal litter with it, but in my experience, it had to be the rounded kind, not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped.  The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid, they jammed it up, causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle. But the rounded ones work well, they just aren't easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter.  But other than that, the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "not perfect but i've loved them", "unixReviewTime": 1190419200, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2007"}

This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried. I'm afraid it wasn't our last, as it had numerous problems.First, the tines would get clumped full of stuff and it would get caked solid rather quickly. I'll note that we didn't even try having this be the \"only\" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.However, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.First, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!We tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn't worth it.

The waste receptacles shouldn't need replacement more often than once every month or so.  And while the unit does make some noise, neither of us have found it excessive or particularly annoying.As noted, the above is based upon my experience with my littermaid as well as neighbor Shirley's experience with hers.  Each of us agree that it sure beats the heck out of scooping the litter out every day.  Also, we have noticed that less litter is required...probably because the unit operates about 10 minutes after use, before the urine soaks up a lot of the litter.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "4 (2 human-2 feline) of us are quite happy with it", "unixReviewTime": 1041465600, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2003"}

I mean cleaning completely, with a new coat of scotch-guard on the pan surface and fresh litter refilled.And that may not make a difference if you have a cat that aims for the plastic tines. And cleaning those is kinda nasty. I've noticed that a new version is out with metal tines.  Maybe the manufacturer's cat had good aim too.Since writing the review below we got a cat with exceptional aim. He could jam up that thing in one session. We were cleaning it every day, and finally opted this year to get a plain old deep rectangular litter pan with scoopable litter and ditch the Litter Maid.  Heck - we were in cleaning it everyday anyway due to our 'artistic' new cat.---------------------------------------I have three cats, all indoor, and you can imagine I've tried about every kind of litter to come up with something workable for both me and the cats.I've had a LitterMate (the larger size) for almost a year now and think this is the next best thing to sliced bread. we liked it so well, we've recently gotten the regular sized one as well since the cats were giving the one we had such a workout.Pros:Our dogs no longer go litter-diving for 'snacks'. The mechanism scares them and most of the contents are now hidden away in the plastic container.The cats are only fascinated by the workings of the litterbox and had no problem adjusting. The oldest was 6, the youngest 5 months.Scoopable litter + three cats previously meant 2-3 times a day  scooping the litterbox. One LitterMate + three cats = 2-3 times a week tray dumping.  The trays are easily reused, making them more economical.The box itself has been dumped and cleaned every other month. The comb is held in place by two screws and is easily removed from the engine to be cleaned. I soak the bottom pan and comb in an antibacterial  cleaner solution, and after it's dry use Scotchguard on both.The house I live in is small - there are few places to hide litterbox odor. This does it effectively.One of our cats like to dig his way to China when he covers his stuff.  I was worried that the scratches on the bottom of the pan would cause more sticking than normal, but a generous coating of Scotchguard keeps things moving along in spite of the battle scars in the LitterMaid.Cons:Yes - litter does escape underneath a little, but with the activities of three cats we were always vaccuming around the litter box anyway - no difference there.The litter flinging problem happened once to me - every time afterwards I threw the garbage bag on top of the tray while I removed it, then just tipped it into the bag. Again, no biggie.Tips:Those lines in the litterbox aren't kidding - don't fill the box over the red line, or the motor will jam.When they say Premium clumping litter, they mean it.  The alternative is a constantly jammed motor.Whenever you empty the tray, pass the scraper through the pan to make sure that nothing escaped the comb along the bottom. Those spots can build up and cause a jam too.If stuff sticks too often to the comb or bottom, it usually means it's time to dumb the entire box and clean and re-coat it with nonsitck spray.

None really prevents it from performing its function (eventually) but all add up to a real pain. One problem is that the plastic boxes that the cat manure is scooped up into do not fit very well into their canister. As a result cat litter seeps through the gaps and you end up having to vacuum underneath every few days. It should not have been that difficult to make a better fitting plastic box or area where it is to be placed.A second problem is that the red \"fill\" line is misleading. If litter is filled up to that point (or even fairly close to it) the machine jams. As a result, to prevent jamming, one needs to fill the device with far below its full capacity. This, in turn, necessitates filling the machine with more cat litter than should be the case (i.e., twice a week instead of once).A third problem is that the rakes, many times, get jammed due to filling up with litter. The rakes should have been made further apart to reduce this.In short, the machine does do its job but with a few relatively minor modifications (that should have been easy to spot for the manufacturer) this machine could have been much improved._______________________________Update:After less than one year machine breaks down and needs to be replaced.

It took a few trials to find a litter that worked well but I settled on Scoop Away. Yes, as some reviewers have mentioned, sometimes it does stick to the bottom and you will have to use the scooper to scrape it up or clean the rakes sometimes. Then, I just turn it on and off and it will rake everything up.  It only takes me a few seconds to check for any stuck spots or even out the litter, turn it on and off to make it rake and then add a little new litter to the top (so the cats think it's nice and clean). :-) It's not completely \"no work\" but it is a lot less work than a \"manual\" litterbox and stays smelling cleaner than manual boxes.  I do use larger plastic grocery bags in the receptacle. It's a lot cheaper than throwing away receptacles every 3-4 days and it's alot easier to clean. Believe me, I do not like trying to pry those receptacles out when it is completely full.  You have to stick your fingers inside to grab onto it (YUCK!) and it's heavy and hard to get out sometimes dumping litter and stuff all over the place (double YUCK).The Seller on Ebay was selling the one I bought with a \"super charged\" motor (which is in the electrical cord). It worked pretty good for almost a year. Apparently, unlike the \"normal motor\", the stronger motor kept it from resetting sometimes when it would hit clumps that were too big for it.  It would attempt to plow right thru which sounds like a good thing, but it wasn't. Apparently the gears and/or sprokets which move the rake along are made of plastic and within a year they were stripped. It started out making a spinning sound once in awhile but would eventually go ahead and rake. One day I came home to a god awful sound. I found the rake stuck right in the middle of the box, gears just spinning and making a heck of a racket. This was enough to scare away ALL 4 cats from the ONLY litterbox. Needless to say we had some accidents. 3 of my cats \"recovered\" and would go back to the disconnected box, but my 20 year old cat was traumatized and refused to use it. So I had to set up the manual box. I'm STILL working with her trying to get her to stop going elsewhere because of this.I took the Littermaid to a repair shop and they knew immediately that the gears were stripped because they'd seen it before. They said they couldn't repair it because they couldn't get parts.I contacted the Ebay Seller who said it was still under warranty. I had to pay shipping to and from the Seller though which was not cheap. The 2nd supercharged Littermaid started doing the same thing after less than 6 months and the Seller says this one is not under warranty. Apparently, the warranty does not extend to the replacement that they sent me which I think is a rip-off considering how expensive these things are.While the 1st Littermaid was being repaired, I went ahead and bought another \"regular\" (not supercharged) Littermaid from Petsmart. I've had it 8 months and had no skipping problems so far. I think the \"supercharged\" motor caused all my problems, but KittenKaboodle refuses to acknowledge this and refused to warranty the 2nd box that they sent me.So, overall it's great when it works, but it could use a few improvements. The bottom of the pan needs to be made of something more \"non-stick\" so the rake can get thru some of the larger wet spots and/or the gears need to be made of something stronger to be able to take a stronger motor that can get thru the stuck on clumps (and not strip the gears). Also I would like to see a slightly larger receptacle on the larger models. They are made for a multi cat household but with only one litterbox it fills up pretty fast. With 2 litterboxes it's not too bad though. I would also like to see some sort of hood like other auto litterboxes that I've seen.

You may work around this requirement by using plain grocery bags to line the receptacles, but after a few weeks of use the receptacles break anyway.Third, the capacity is lacking; When I got my second cat I found out I had to empty out the machine practically every day. If I waited for the second day, the container would overfill, sometimes because all the clumps were on the same side, keeping the lid open (you can imagine the smell)Finally, my youngest cat has a very fragile stomach. Well let me tell you, the raking process is not designed to handle runny poo. This was the last drop in the bucket, which prompted me to do some research on the web. Six months ago, I bought the litter-robot (litter-robot dot com), and my two cats and I couldn't be more satisfied.In summary, the LitterMaid is great if you only have one cat who never gets the runs.

Try setting it up with the power off for a few days and then turn it on after the cat gets use to using the box. The only other issue is that there is a raking motion that pushes all the waste forward but it also pushes good litter with it so the end result is good litter gets dumped into the plastic bin.  I had the option of buying the newer unit but read so many bad reviews that I decided to go for one of the older models.  I also build a table with a hole in it.

I still think I got a good deal out of it though.So recently I bought the same litter box again only this time it REQUIRES  you to use the premium cat litter so I bought the \"scoop away\" cat litter at the supermarket. This litter is supposed to be better than the regular litter because it is more absorbent than the regular and it clumps and drys more quickly than the traditional kitty litter. Since the Littermaid Litter box rakes the litter 10 minutes after the cat leaves, you need a litter that can clump and dry quickly. Well, now I get this! Since I bought the litter box (2 weeks ago) I havent had any clogs and am actually using less Kitty litter than before since it clumps so well.The litterbox is turnkey provided you use the premium kitty litter. I am really glad I bought this product. I am happy...Oh, another point, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE KITTY LITTER LEVEL BELOW THE SUGGESTED LINE.

We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one.

I've always found them to be great, but not very long lived.My littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times.  So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit's motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake's cord broke, and couldn't reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running.My first Littermaid was the original.  It lasted about 4 years.  The next was the original \"Mega Advance\" and was the best when it was working.  That only lasted about 3-4 years.  The last Mega (not advance) lasted about 5-6 years, but was very noisy.This newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega, but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip.  Both nice improvements.  The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake, a great idea that only took 15 years....I've never run my Littermaids on batteries, always using the A/C plug.  If the power's out for a few hours, we can survive, or if needed, scoop.If there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.Tips:1.  Don't over-fill the box.  Use the bottom (add litter) line as the top fill line.  If you fill to the top line, the system will not work as well.  This seems to be the #1 problem people have, adding too much litter.2.  Use a bit of cooking oil spray (Pam) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter.  I rarely clean ours, but when I do, I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom.3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us.4.  Re-use the waste containers.  They each should last a month or more. Just keep using them until they crack when you are removing to dump the contents.  Then replace.  Saves lots of money there.This would be a 5 star if it was just a bit more quiet overall.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Must have appliance for the lazy cat owner", "unixReviewTime": 1252540800, "reviewTime": "09 10, 2009"}

Must've been around 1994 or 95.  Not too long after that, i got the tent.  I went through about 3 or 4 Litter Maids in that time, the motors kept working but they got too dirty and it was time for a fresh one, was my thinking.  That one tent outlived all those litter Boxes.  For me, the tent was great, I liked that it was light weight. It wasn't too flimsy, i could always easily unzip it and zip it back.  Sorry to hear the new ones are poorer quality, i hate when that happens. I have ordered one because i am about to start using a Litter Maid again after a couple of years with a Litter Robot, and when i took the tent apart last time, when i got rid of the last Litter Maid, one piece of the frame wouldn't go back on, i don't know why. But i have to say that overall, that one tent i had certainly held up well. My cat is not rough on things so that may be part of my success with this item on my first experience.  At that time, i had recently moved into an apartment that didn't allow pets, but we already had the cat before we moved in so since she is small, quiet and an indoor cat, i thought i would try and see if i could keep her under cover. The tent was perfect. The manager rarely came into my apartment, only for rare repair incidents, and when he would come, i would drap a table cloth over the tent. At worst, if he came in unexpectedly because of an emergency, i don't remember that happening but if it had, the tent itself would not suggest that there was a cat toilet there.  the tent always did a great job of keeping the odor contained. The tent was crucial to my situation and i have good memories of it.  If i'd known they were going to start making a poorer quality tent, i would've saved the other one. It wasn't worn out. Just one piece of the frame came loose and i tried to get it to go back but it wouldn't. I abandoned it too easily probably because i was switching over to the Litter Robot at that time. At first i gave the tent 4 stars just now, but i have to change it to 5 because my tent lasted about 12 years and was still in good shape when i stopped using it, and it really helped me out by minimizing the mess and odor of a cat box, and camouflaged my catbox so that my cover was never blown. I have ordered the current model of the tent and am definitely concerned after reading the bad reviews. It sounds like maybe there is not much quality control and maybe some units are better cut than others. one can only speculate.  i have my fingers crossed.  i will update my review if the assessment changes.10/3/10 UpdateA year ago when i wrote the above, i ordered a new one of these, despite bad reviews.  I wanted the litter Maid to be in a tent, so i ordered it.  It was unusable.  The cover was much too tight for the frame, and it's a really cheap zipper, the little zipper teeth don't mesh together around the whole length of the zipper.I assembled it when i got it and since then, a year ago, it's sat unused in the spare bedroom. It was really diffcult getting it set up because the cover is too tight, but what made it unusable for me is that in order to clean the litter box i need to unzip it partially so i can pull back the tent flaps and get to the litter box.  The zipper is so flimsy and the cover so tight that extreme pressure has to be applied to open or close the zipper, unlike my old original litter maid tent which was tight enough but not a big production to unzip and re-zip. i never even thought about it.  The zipper on the new model i have is so flimsy that it would never hold up under the kind of puilling necessary to open and close it.I just now disassembled it because i'm going to be moving back to my house and i am packing stuff up. It was really hard to unzip and the teeth of the zipper were unmeshed in places.  Very poor.I left the 3 star rating instead of 1 star because the original version of these was so good, lasting a cat's lifetime without problems, i want to give some notice to the fact that it's a good idea with a good design and low cost compared to the fancy litter box disguises, and to the longevity and sturdiness of the original one.  But i would not recommend buying this one, although Amazon will take it back if it's defective so if anyone wants to try it out, your mileage may vary.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "it's the only alternative", "unixReviewTime": 1250467200, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2009"}

I have 3 dogs, 1 of which is always having normal stools, the second has intermittent diarrhea, and the third always has an issue with soft/loose stools.  I initially tried it on my 2 and it cleared up the diarrhea with the one immediately.  The other one who always had an issue with intermittent loose/watery stools, I had her on another regimen which over time gave her stools form, but it was rather costly and she didn't always like eating it (herbal regimen).  This, however, is very easy for me to give to her as she only requires one capsule of which I open into her bowl and mix with canned dog food then hand feed to make sure she eats it, and she eats it as if it were a treat.  I can then feed her the normal dry kibble in her bowl afterwards.  I am continuing this on a daily regiment with my one dog.  I recommend it.  The price is very reasonable and it is easily dispensed.  I am not certain, but I guess you could also just feed the entire capsule to your dog, but I prefer opening it so I know it will work quickly.Update:  August 2013.  I am now feeding 1 capsule daily to both of my dogs who had  loose stool issues.  Once their stools were firm (within a couple of days of opening capsule and adding to wet food), I am now dispensing the entire capsule and everything is fine.  I have one very finicky senior gal so she will only take her meds with peanut butter (she can't spit it out as I scoop it on the roof of her mouth).  Pill pockets work just as well with my other pooch, but since I have gone the route of peanut butter with one, they all get the peanut butter with pills...and it's much cheaper!

(Viruses aren't a big problem, since they don't use food as a substrate; they look for living tissue to thrive in.) The stomach with its high acidity helps kill most bacteria and fungus, but some survive and get to the small and large intestine, where they can cause disease that is commonly called food poisoning.  Part of the problem is when there is missing 'good' bacteria that has been killed off or dies for some reason.  This niche may be filled by the bad bugs, leading to an unbalanced fauna in the gut.Pets have the same problem as we do.  And you know what a dog will eat; just about anything!

I never had a mechanical problem and my first couple of months with the product were uneventful. However, I soon found that it created much more work and hassel than a traditional litter box with plastic liners.One problem I faced was that if the storage bin became full, the clumps would pile up and the lid would not close. Sometimes, the clumps would even spill out of the side of the bin, creating a stinky mess. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that my cats had a tendency to use only one side of the litter box, so the bin would be full on that side in a short amount of time, causing extreme odor and spills. And, with 2 cats, it does not take long to fill that little storage bin, so if you have multiple cats, plan to empty it every couple of days.In addition, I found that the bottom of the box and the rake needed to be cleaned frequently so that they did not accumulate a build-up of crusty litter. If a build-up occurs on the bottom of the box, it will eventually become thick and hard enough that the rake will not be able to pass smoothly through the litter. After chiseling the dried litter off of the bottom of the box a few times (gross!) and dealing with the hassel of having to shake the contents of the storage bin in order to level it out, I finally decided that all of this hassel was not worth it and literally THREW THIS PRODUCT AWAY!

(i explained all the other troubleshooting things i'd done, which are described clearly in the manual.)well, here we are 25 days after ordering, so probably three weeks into daily use. i still have to turn it on and off manually. now, that wouldn't be a HUGE deal, since i'm in there anyway feeding the kittehs. however, because i can't sense when it's been 10 minutes since either cat went in, i have to hope that the clumps are fully formed. i think it has happened that way for me twice. the rest of the times, the mushy clod of unclumped kitty-pee mixed with the clay litter sticks to the rake as it goes through its little journey. also doesn't sound like HUGE deal, does it? well...turns out that the rake doesn't hit the aforementioned sensors until it goes alllll the way to the receptacle end and then allll the way to the resting end. and it can't push through the litter if a big ol' piece of you-know-what is blocking the openings between the rake's teeth. so every time it runs now, i have to sit beside it and use the little toothed plastic scoop to try to get all the gunk out from between the teeth. usually it still hasn't pushed the litter into an even surface by then, so the litter forms little dunes at either end, and it can't get up into the resting position. and i don't want to leave it partially out of the resting position, because that's down the side of the box into the...work area, and a kitteh will ...work on it. so i spend at least as much time as i'd spend scooping a regular box that size to get it cleared out all the way, getting the glued-to-the-bottom gunk out, and cleaning the rake until i can get it far enough up out of the box that nothing will get on it.and the return policy is that you have to return the item in its original condition and packaging. well, i got yer packaging right here, but i am prettty sure that this does not qualify as original condition. oh, did i mention that the gunk gets all up on the track and the sides of the rake? so those have to be cleaned off with a paper towel or something every few days.the good news is that the cats took to it right away--one of them with no urging at all (in fact, while i was still setting it up), and the other when the old box got dirty enough. the bad news is that i'm losing my patience with this contraption and putting it out with the trash any minute. the big boxes--which are easy to scoop, even if that's no fun--are much easier for me. and for now they're in closets or otherwise out of the way, rather than having to be plugged in in the main room.when our third bathroom is finished, i'm aiming for a cat genie, the box with the washable granules that flushes fluid waste away and scoops the poop into a receptacle. it's three times the price of the littermaid, but i'm betting it won't be worse than this.(i can't remember ever writing a negative review before for a product, and certainly not one this negative. think how ..fill in your favorite adjective here.. i must have been to get back on amazon to look for this product again just to write this review. sad.)", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "wish i'd just lined the box with $100 bills.", "unixReviewTime": 1227484800, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2008"}

These units are generally reliable.  The biggest benefit is the odor control.  The dirty stuff is raked into a plastic catch-bin that has a lid.  The smell is kept to a minimum, until the catch-bin is too full and the lid doesn't close fully.My first LitterMaid's retractable power cord (on the rake) stopped recoiling into the unit, so it eventually got snagged on the rake, and it broke.  That was after more than 3 years of use.  Not bad for a product that runs at least 10-15 times a day (I've got 2 cats).  My second LitterMaid has been going strong since I replaced the last one well over 2 years ago.The most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter.  I've been very happy with the ScoopAway brand.  Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess.  The next thing is to keep the litter level below the \"max fill\" line.  Too much litter causes the rake to bog down.  Also, cooking oil spray (pam) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.I use the \"disposable\" catch pans over and over until they crack.  I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out.  I can't imagine tossing it out after one filling.  That's a big expense, and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item.  I don't use a liner/bag in the catch.  Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash.  I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days.  Normally, I just dump the bin, use a scoop to quickly get the smaller bits missed by the rake, and that's it.  I have gone well over 6 months before doing any major cleaning of the box.If you have more than one cat, I would get the \"Mega\" model, since it is bigger.  The new Advanced model isn't getting good reviews here at Amazon, so I would keep away from that unit.The LitterMaids are a bit noisy.  That maybe the biggest drawback.  Also, it is not a perfect cleaner, and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days.  There are times when litter will build up in the back of the pan, and the rake will cycle over and over until you level things off (this can mostly be avoided by not filling to the top fill line).  It takes a few weeks to work out all the kinks, but once you do, you will love it.I will always own a LitterMaid because it keeps the house smelling like we don't have cats.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1162598400, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2006"}

She LOVES the FIVE squeakers, and it's a great soft, squishy size.  (FYI, my dog is a 7-year-old 70lb Golden Retriever female; she's typically somewhat gentle on stuffies, although she's certainly destroyed her fair share, too).  For MYYYY dog (and I know this doesn't work with all dogs), if she sees me cuddle and pet her toy for a while first before letting her play with it, she tends to not destroy it (or, at least, not as quickly).  I'm not sure if it's because it gets my scent on it or if she decides that my actions mean it's to be 'babied.\"  I guess I'm playing into her maternal instinct.  This has absolutely been her FAVORITE toy for the LONGEST of all, so I definitely recommend it if stuffies are at all an option for your dog.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Her faaaavorite!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1316131200, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2011"}

I removed the batting from the rest of the body and placed Mr.s Bill's head with the soundmaker inside into a long men's sock (think sock monkey). I placed more batting around Mr. Bill's head to give soundmaker more cushioning.  Suggestion: it may be a good idea to use packing tape on the outside of the soundmaker itself to keep it intact (just in case you have dog that likes to chew). One sock is not enough cushion surrounding Mr. Bill's head though because holes can be made easily into just one sock layer and the jaw pressure from a dog's mouth could break the plastic on the soundmaker. Because of this, I suggest 2-3 socks (short or long on the inside) with the outermost sock long because then you can tie 2-3 knots at the end.  What you have is a long body that you can draw some eyes on with permanent marker on one end of the body and the knots at the other end will be like a rope toy.Pros from this design:-dog can play with either end of the toy.-person can throw toy (without much drool) with the knotted end easily.-more stuffing= more protection for the soundmaker you wanted to reuse.-it's easier to notice when the toy is being destroyed- then you just rewrap in another sock!Toy Diagram (Size approximate):[--10 inches long---] & 2-3 inches wide/~~~~~~~~~\\|~O~~~~~~~||~O~~~~~~~|--^-^-^--\\|~~~~~~~~~|--~-~-~--/\\~~~~~~~~~/", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Soundmaker lasts a long time if you remake it into another toy.", "unixReviewTime": 1296259200, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2011"}

Things like a loofa toy don't last 10 minutes and even the stuffingless toys are torns to shreds in short order.  I have had these two over a month now and only had to do minor repair. Though these toys do have stuffing so you have to watch your dogs, only portions of the toy rip easily for access to the stuffing (like the face). I have taught the puppy that if he tears his toy, \"mommy\" will just sew it up with dental floss and then he has to find a new place to tear. He learned quickly and no longer destroys every toy when it arrives! (If you do this, do yourself a favor and use the regular unflavored dental floss. I made the mistake of using a mint floss the first time I sewed up Lambchop and the puppy licked the poor lamby until it was one big spitball.) It turned out that both the puppy and the Lab are enamored with Lambchop and I was about to order two more but when I read the tag I discoverd these are made in China. I am usually very careful about food and toys that are made in China but had neglected to check this item. My vet says you need to be careful - particularly of the dye on toys made in China - and Mr Bill is heavily dyed. Though my dogs have had no ill effects from the toys they have to date I may give it more time before reordering.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Longest lasting toy I have tried - but made in China", "unixReviewTime": 1381536000, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2013"}

These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly \"indestructible\" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you're tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and are easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers.  Even better, they're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four!

Our dog is not a \"sit down and try to rip apart\" kind of dog, but she does love to play tug-o-war!  I usually grip the head while she grabs onto either the squeaking body or one of the limbs, and she hops and pulls and shakes and play-growls until she gets too thirsty to continue.  Hubby and I also play keep-away with the bear, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever).  Sometimes she'll pick up the bear and bring it over to me to let me know it's time to play, but otherwise she really doesn't play with the bear on her own.  Not the fault of the bear, it's just the way my sheltie is, and I hope it gives you a better idea of how this bear might hold up with your dog.This bear came with a free replacement squeaker, which I placed inside the fleece bag that contains the other squeaker, for extra squeaking fun.  Probably because of the extra protection the fleece gives, both squeakers have survived my little girl's needle sharp teeth.  The fleece thing inside the bear also gives it bulk, without that messy stuffing that dogs so love to pull out.  I could hear and feel stitches pop on occasion while playing tug-o-war, but this toy really has held up well compared to other plush dog toys.  For 5 months, this bear looked perfect, other than the slobber on it.  Our bear has about three sizeable holes and is missing a bit of fur on its chest, which all happened in the last month, but we still use it because there's no stuffing in the bear.  I'm currently looking for another Dr. Noys toy as a replacement, when that teddy bear goes to tug-o-war heaven.In addition to being very sturdy, this bear is super cute.  I have a photo of the Dr. Noys teddy bear in the arms of my sheltie who was laying down, and it's a photo I'll cherish forever.**UPDATE**  We've purchased our 2nd Dr. Noys teddy bear in medium size.  I tried buying regular stuffed animals, the kind intended for kids, at second hand stores but they all got pulled apart.

I don't think any are truly \"indestructible\" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)  In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you're tired of buying so-called \"dog toys\" that are really glorified baby toys and easily destroyed, try these. Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers. Even better, they're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four (smaller sizes)!  That way you can test out different designs, or save one for later.

Held up quite well (looked perfect for the first 5 months), so I decided to get another Dr. Noys toy for my little girl, as she loves stuffed toys.I don't use this medium-size Frosty Dog for tug-o-war, as it's a bit too small, she ends up accidentally biting my fingers when she tries to get a better grip on the toy (didn't have that problem with the medium size teddy bear).So instead, my husband and I play keep-away with the Frosty Dog, tossing it back and forth so she'll run between us for some exercise (she's not much of a retriever).  When we throw it short so she has a chance to get the toy, she pounces on it and prances around with it in her mouth like it's the best thing ever.  She'll also run to her toy box and select this toy when my husband is laying on the floor doing back exercises, and she'll plop the Frosty Dog on his chest as a not-so-subtle way of saying \"Since you're down here at my level, play with me!\".  Sometimes when our sheltie is super happy, she'll pick the Frosty Dog up and hold it in her mouth for a minute, squeaking the toy every couple seconds, just for the joy of it.  The squeaker has held up great over 2 months of her joyful squeaking.  She simply loves this toy.My dog is not a determined toy destroyer, thankfully.  But, based on my experience with my other Dr. Noys teddy bear toy, their toys are built to be far superior to other plush toys.**UPDATE**  September 13th, 2008:  Last week, I had to take this toy away because Zoey had managed to pluck open the side of the Frosty Dog's face, exposing the irresistible stuffing inside.  Curses!  If I had sewing skills, I'd take upholstery thread (tough stuff!) and sew it back up.  But, I don't have sewing skills.  Double curses!  I'm searching for a new toy.  *sigh*  Still, the Frosty Dog lasted over 4 months, that's not too bad.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gotta love Dr. Noys dog toys", "unixReviewTime": 1214006400, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2008"}

They all had fleas after I forgot to treat my dog before I went on a lengthy vacation and one of my cats ended up living outside for two weeks (escaped while I was on vacation).  Anyway, I was so worried and upset when I discovered that my pets had fleas.  I gave them all flea baths, picked off live fleas, gave them other flea treatments that didn't seem to work (the store-bought flea drops, for example), washed linens, and I still could not get rid of them or even see a dent in the population.  That's when I decided to start hunting online for a solution since taking them all to the vet would be very expensive.I bought the large dog Advantage (>55 lbs) with the intent to divide it amongst my pets.  I used all but 0.5 ml of one vial for the first treatment.  I have not treated them a second time yet, but they are due very soon.  After treatment, the place on their back was not greasy.  In fact, by the second day, I couldn't even tell they had something put on their backs, and it didn't smell bad.  It did not smell AT ALL.  On day one, I found quite a few fleas laying around on the bed blanket. They had evidently jumped off the pets.  They seemed very confused and slow, but were still alive.  I made sure I killed them in case they were only temporarily impaired.  By the next day, I could find no evidence of fleas on my pets....not even any flea debris (I guess the pets had groomed themselves to remove it). All the pets were extremely thankful for treatment and extra loving after they no longer had fleas pestering them.I've continued to snuggle with my pets, checking them daily for fleas or signs of them, and monitor the bedding for any evidence of fleas.  NOTHING to be seen or found!  I am so happy with the Advantage flea treatment!  I will treat them all again in a few days in order to make sure any new eggs hatching don't re-infest the pets.I put 1 ml each on a 13 lb rat terrier, 20 lb cat, and 16 lb cat.  On my smaller 6 lb cat, I administered 0.5 ml.  I certainly wanted to make sure I gave them enough since I think I had a serious flea problem and knew some of the medicine would be rubbed off onto their surroundings.  They suffered no ill effects, only benefits, from the Advantage.  I benefited greatly by only spending $31.50 on Advantage that would treat all of my pets (4) for 4 months (plus 2 large pets for another month OR the dog for two more months, who is really the one who needs protection since he goes potty outside).

However, you don't have to be a technician to do a google or wikipedia search to learn a little bit before writing an ignorant review. The vast majority of the bad reviews I have read here, are obviously (to me) from people who really do not understand where fleas come from and what you have to do to eliminate them.Here's the thing: 90% of the flea population that feeds off of your pet are NOT ON THE ANIMAL RIGHT NOW. That's right, the vast majority of the pests are actually on your floors, carpets, furniture, pet beds and so forth - waiting to hop on Spike and Fluffy when they are hungry. Fleas feed, then jump off the animal, while some more of their family jump on and start feeding in their place. To truly manage the flea problem requires TREATING THE ANIMAL AND THE PREMISES. If you do not treat the premises (including the yard) you will never get ahead of the problem. Sevin dust in the yard or some pyrethrin-based spray have been effective for me for many many years.Also, the lack of effectiveness that people think they are seeing is not because the product is not as good, it is because the fleas have become tougher over the years.

The drug in Advantage for Dogs and Advantage for Cats is exactly the same drug (Imidacloprid) at the same concentration.If you buy this \"Large Dog\" package, you get four 4ml tubes. If you then empty those into a vial or vials, you can use a syringe (without needle) to apply the right dosage to your dogs AND cats. In fact, if your cats are under 10 pounds, you can get 10 cat doses out of each of these vials. That's a real bargain!Advantage II is the same, but adds Pyriproxyfen for the full life cycle coverage.Use the following chart and you will be fine.Cats up to 9 pounds - 0.4mlCats 10+ pounds - 0.8mlDogs 11-20 pounds - 1.0mlDogs 21-55 pounds - 2.5mlDogs 55+ pounds - 4.0ml", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Product is brilliant - people who buy it and write bad reviews, not so much!", "unixReviewTime": 1343260800, "reviewTime": "07 26, 2012"}

So if you have some stains so tough that absolutely nothing seems to get them out, this one might not work miracles.

You see, my husband is an avid hunter and although we did not buy the dog only for hunting - we wanted a family dog that can go like we do - we had hoped that one way we could get him exercised would be through retrieving. We attempted to begin the awakening of genetics early (the day we brought him home). However, we have children, and although we warned them many times and watched the dog training videos together, as a family, on a loop for days - they thought playing chase and tag with him was a load of fun (which, lets be honest, it is)! Needless to say, he would chase the ball, BUT good luck getting him to bring it back! After the children realized what they had actually done - they vowed no more chase with balls...and we have attempted to begin the training over again. A couple of months ago I started working with him with a Kong ball - the red one. He would retrieve for a little bit - 5 or so throws and then start messing around. I read and watched more videos and worked/played more with him...but he would lose interest, and I had a SLIMEY hand - gross. So, when I saw the Chuck-it and it was on sale - I bought it. I thought at least my hand would not be so icky. It was L-o-V-e at first throw for this guy! He is absolutely obsessed! We bought the rubber balls as he is an avid chewer and would destroy a tennis ball in 2 seconds flat - and the rest is history. I don't think the only reason he is retrieving now is due only to the Chuck-It being so awesome, although it is pretty great. We really worked with him.

Using a standard pressure-less ball, presumably the Chuck-it ball would go farther.  This extra throw-distance appears to be mostly from the thinner and smoother arm.  Less wind resistance.The thinner arm does feel a little more flexible, but it's still very controllable.  It's easy to place the throw exactly where one wants.The Pro version is about an inch shorter than the 26M, which may not matter to most folks, but it means an extra inch bending over.  An inch won't matter to most, but if one has a bad back and a dog that insists on fifty or more tosses per session, it adds up.  Nevertheless, the dog gets a better workout and the Pro version is worth the extra few bucks.The handle is much more comfortable too.  Rubberized and form-fitting.  The original Chuck-it was the best man-dog interactive toy ever; this new Pro version is a refinement over the original and well worth it..", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pro", "unixReviewTime": 1375228800, "reviewTime": "07 31, 2013"}

So this chuck it launcher is awesome because now we can go and have fun and she can really get going.

Also, it doesn't pick up as much dirt, so it stays cleaner too.  This was a problem I saw with my dog because the regular tennis balls collected so much dirt that she would accidentally swallow some as she was fetching and then end up dry heaving later that night.....I also suggest getting the pro version of chuck it because the handle is soooo much better that its worth the extra money.Caution though...if you throw it to far and your dog isnt paying attention or isnt quick enough to find it before it stops bouncing...you will be walking a long way to find the ball for them...especially if you paid extra money for the nicer chuckit ultra balls.  Luckily my dog is OCD and has to have the first ball we throw, so if she misses it she searches for it for at least 10  min before giving up.Oh and the Chuckit works ok with regular tennis balls, but it is sized just a bit smaller than a tennis ball size.

The best way to lob a ball a goodly distance is to NOT insert the ball all the way into the head.

Pretend you are a kid again and swing your arm like a windmill.  Just stop the motion when your arm is pointing straight towards the heavens.  The ball will launch at least 50-80 feet in an arch.

It is VERY sturdy looking, with raised sides, so my dog can find the edge and feel more secure.  She will go up this one, unlike most other ramps.  The raised ridges on the walking surface are great, no slipping or sliding, even with wet or snowy paws.  However, this thing weighs a ton!  It is very difficult to lift and carry and even though we have only had it a few months, mostly folded, lying flat in our semi-heated garage, it has warped!  We have only used it about a dozen times, at best, as our dog has been laid up with leg problems (that's why we need this).  We've only used it every couple of weeks to go to the vet.  Not sure why this is warping, but for now, it is still useable.  We also bought the half-sized version to go up two steps into the house and have had no problem with that version, just this one.  Very disappointed about the warping, don't like the weight (or higher price), but would probably buy this one again, as it is the ONLY one our dog feels sure-footed on and will use.  Not sure why a dog ramp needs to support 500 pounds, as no dog I've ever seen comes close to that!  (Have you?)

I planned to post a review of this product in about a month, but had to post this early in case it helped someone else in our situation with their dog.  So here is/was our situation.  Out of the blue one day while on vacation, my dog screamed in pain when walking up the 3 steps to our motorhome.  It was so heartbreaking and she ended up at a pet ER while we were traveling.  She was put on pain medication until we returned home.  After many unsuccessful vet visits,  it was determined by a specialist that our beagle has luxating patellas (kneecaps that pop out of joint).  She would always walk fine on level ground where no steps were involved.  So we had been carrying her inside her metal crate up and down our outside deck steps so she could do her thing!  A 25 lb. beagle AND a metal crate that has to weigh at least 15 lbs conservatively!  This had been going on since this past May when she experienced her first incident of obvious pain when going up steps.  I looked and researched many ramps, but this one was the only one made with a rubbery surface, although I think the entire ramp is some sort of plastic, but with incredibly good traction.  I did what another reviewer suggested, laid it flat on the floor inside of the house and within a day, with some coaxing and food, she easily walked back and forth over it that way.  Well, today, I decided to put it outside on the steps down to our patio, and didn't think she'd take to going down the ramp, much less up the ramp, right away.  Once again, food did the trick!  She didn't even hesitate, and walked down the ramp to retrieve the food, and back up again to retrieve the food, as my husband stood at one end, and I the other.  So in less than a week, she has really taken to it much more quickly than I expected.  So if anyone is on the fence about it, I highly recommend it, and the weather probably won't hurt it since it's made of hard plastic and rubber.  It has one little latch to fold it shut, but I just carry it sideways folded under my arm like a suitcase to move it if needed.

Since they are prone to all types of joint issues, I thought I would start early trying to protect him. Diesel is 8.5 months old. I have a Dodge Diesel 2500 pick up and they are quite tall. Diesel never wanted to go in by himself so that would leave me to hoist his large 80lb butt into the truck. Then after jumping down he would sometimes limp and was always very nervous about jumping out. So this ramp fixed all that. After receiving it I set it up into the truck and called him into the garage. He looked at it, grinned at me and up he went,then down,then up...you get the picture. I know this is not the correct way to train, but when Diesel's in the mood he catches on real quick. He loves rides so he is always impatient for me to set it up so he can get in the truck. But he does manage to wait with great distress. He climbs quickly up the ramp and I am happy that it has a non-slip surface that is permanent not stuck on, and the sides remind him not to step off. It fits ok on the lip of the underneath part of my truck seats if the seats are in the upright position. It's tight but it fits. This thing is heavy when you are trying to unfold it and hold onto a large puppy. The weight is the only downfall, but it's also what makes this sturdy and built so well.

I used it for several months on my front steps (placed over 2 deep steps) with my 75lb. alaskan husky who has unsteady drooping hind legs due to a health condition.  It didn't work with my car, so I can't attest to using it for that purpose.Cons, first:-It's not really wide enough for a large dog with an unsteady gait (unless guided very carefully).  However, if you are a DIY'er and are placing this in one stationary spot, you could likely attach boards along the sides to prevent falling.  We had a few scary moments with this ramp because of the width and low sides.-The ridges are deep (deep enough that they really do prevent the dog from sliding down, but also made it uncomfortable for my dog to go up, as very uneven surfaces are hard for him to maneuver).  Wish the ridges were a bit more shallow, as the non-slip surface seems powerful on its own.-No bottom supports (not an issue for small dogs, but for larger dogs, the fact that there are no supports and is hinged in the middle means that there is some give when the dog walks on it - this made my dog a little nervous, but not enough that it would prevent me from purchasing it).  This is more of a FYI than a con.-I left mine in one spot, so this was irrelevant for me, but it is fairly heavy (this coming from a small-framed woman).Pros:-The rubber feet at the top seemed to hold well.-Folds for storage and transporting.-The rubberized non-slip surface is awesome!!!  I used it during the winter (and even regularly heated water in a tea kettle to pour over the surface for melting snow/ice) and it performed wonderfully.-This is superficial, but I love that it is khaki-colored, as it blended in better with my concrete steps and was less obvious than darker colored ones.Eventually I ended up building my own custom ramp, only because the ridges on this ramp were too deep for my dog.

She's only thirty-five pounds but she goes through most toys like they're bubblegum. Even as a small puppy, she would destroy anything and everything. By the age of five or six months we had to give up on soft and rope toys altogether, and at a year old, she is limited to only hard chews like Kong, Nylabone, etc. Even then, she destroys most of these with relative ease. She's gone through chews others have recommended as long-lasting in literally ten minutes. The only toy she has that has lasted more than a month or so is her original red Kong, which she mostly licks instead of chews.I initially bought the dinosaur for my other, less toy-murderous dog, but the power chewer quickly stole it from him. She was in love. She carried it everywhere and chewed on it constantly. I'm not sure if it's the shape or the texture she likes, or some combination thereof, but whatever the case, it instantly became her favorite. Even the most durable hard toys normally only last a few weeks with her, but her dino is going on two or three months now. It's chewed beyond recognition, all the nubs worn down, and it's very rapidly nearing the end of its life because little bits of plastic are falling off, but it still lasted far longer than most toys do. A few weeks ago I bought her a second one, in a different shape, and she's equally as enamored with it.

We got the stegosaurus toy and so far, it's held up. She's a ferocious chewer--we can't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits. The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body, and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once, meaning she can't play with this unless we're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it. It would've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering. I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured, which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail. The good news is, steggie doesn't have a small projectile head or tail, but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail, so no worries about small pieces coming off there. The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars, but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.UPDATE: I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs, tail, head, and half the body.

He has the same reaction to the bacon-flavored hollow stick.Before buying, know your dog's chewing style; not just based on breeds, but your actual pet. I have done a fair amount of research online, reading reviews, and talking to pet store clerks to find out this is not an uncommon behavior. Teething puppies are figuring out the world and will put anything in their mouth but may prefer a hard surface to push their teeth against into their gums. Then, with adult teeth, they may want to use their powerful teeth to destroy. So, this toy will likely fail to redirect destructive behavior because they will not be able to cause any damage. My dog quickly lost interest and started gnawing on his previously ignored teething bone, which I had to quickly take away after two days. He got one good day out of the teething bone, exposing the dental bristles, but was breaking off much larger pieces on day two and would have destroyed the whole thing in under and hour if I had not separated him from it. Now, I am stuck with two durachews and not quite sure how to spark his interest in either.Pro: Teething puppy looking for hard surfaceCon: Useless for powerful chewer that cannot dent", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Waste of Money if your Dog like to Destroy", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014"}

She didn't want our dog to have anything harder than a tooth to chew on (including bones and hard plastic toys like this) because of the potential to crack his teeth. Even though he's a puppy, she was concerned about the possibility of infection and abscess in a cracked tooth and the dangers of putting a puppy under for oral surgery to extract the cracked tooth/teeth.

They last a substantial amount of time without bursting and do not leave behind any residue that I have detected.  I use them on an outside wood porch.

However specific proteins and essential vitamins and trace minerals would be missed.I mention this only to re enforce that although Nupro isn't a replacement for a healthy diet - it can enhance what ever food you are currently feeding your pooch.As a dog lover who has never been without a dog or three for 50 plus years. I have been making my own dog food for over thirty.Long before the was an Internet I was teaching myself all I could about canine nutrition. My self education continues - and I remain highly suspect of any commercial dog food.Especially if you consider that out of literally thousands of brands and sub brands - there are a mere 14 considered safe and healthy. Since the founding of Nupro some 25 years ago there has never been a single instance of a recall, tainted ingredient or other unfortunate mishap.Using palatable desiccated (powdered) liver as a base Nupro adds the following:1) Kelp - rich in trace minerals and iodine Kelp is proven to improve glandular functions and provide  a rich source of natural vitamins A, B1, B2, C, and E.2) Amino Acids and Enzymes - proven to strengthen the immune system in dogs and humans.3) Flax Seed - Great source of Omega 3 Fats. Unlike fish oils no smell and what is more, no chance of mercury.4) Lecithin - long applauded for it's effect on brain, nerve and healthy liver function.5) Allicin (highly condensed garlic oil) Proven to fight cardiovascular disease. A powerhouse of anti oxidants.6) Lactobacillus Acidophilus - Helps regulate the digestive system, reduces gas, bloating and stomach upset. Can compliment the use of whole fat yogurt for those who use it.Nupro is in powdered form and does not need to be refrigerated. Over the past year, I have exchanged emails with founder and she is eager to answer any questions and support any claims with factual studies and information.My only real concern with Nupro is that I believe the initial dose recommendations are far too excessive.The company would benefit by adding label information addressed to those dogs with sensitive stomachs and or digestive problems.But common sense should prevail. Never overload a new ingredient to any dogs diet. Acclimation should be reduced to the smallest denominator.Rather than one large scoop (included) I would advise a teaspoon at most for dogs over 50 lbs and significantly less for smaller dogs. For finicky eaters Nupro can be mixed with a little warm water to make a gravy - and who doesn't like gravy?By adding Nupro to your dogs diet you can expect to see:1) Dramatic improvement in the coat. More shine and less shedding.2) Less stomach upset3) Firmer stools4) Higher balanced behavior and more energy5) Improved breathNupro is an excellent time proven product.Used conservatively in the beginning both you and your beloved pooch and or pooches should experience an overall improvement in many areas of your dogs overall health and well being.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sensational Whole Food Based Supplement", "unixReviewTime": 1336348800, "reviewTime": "05 7, 2012"}

I guess the most astonishing thing we've seen is this:  Georgia is a 15 year old cocker mix who had become pitiful looking.  First of all, she was covered in these wart like things---literally covered.  The vet would express some of them, but nothing took them away.  She is my sisters dog and I would not even touch her because the warts grossed me out.  Secondly, she had lost so much oh her hair that we called her baboon butt and her tail looked like the Grinches Christmas tree.  Seriously, you could hold it up and it had a few scraggly hairs hanging off a bald tail.  Thirdly, she was very gray.  So, I had not seen Georgia in about a month and when she walked in I thought my sister had a new dog.  Georgia's is now a luscious, glossy black ( except for her face) her fur is thick, soft and her tail  fur is completely full.  It truly is mind blowing and I would not have believed it had I not seen it.  Her warts are almost completely gone and she has so much energy.  I swear her eyesight and hearing are better but my sis does not agree with that.  As far as my 9 year old Lily- she acts like a 2 year old now.  My sisters other 2 dogs have the softest, silkiest fur you have ever seen and are the picture of health.  Just started my moms buddy on this and sending some home with my brother for his Romeo.  If I could but stock in this company I would.  Oh-  in terms of Lily's plaque?  Gone, period.  And I could not even break it off with a scraper.  We actually make homemade dog food (chicken, kale, sweet potato, broccoli, etc. no grain) and I just mix this in as I process it, freeze and pull out daily.

He would struggle a bit to get up after lying down for a while and would typically showcase a light limp for the first few minutes after standing.  After monitoring him for about two weeks to make sure it wasn't a mild sprain and seeing the condition neither improve or get worse, I started him on both this Nupro supplement andVetri-Science Laboratories Methylsulfonylmethane 250 Supplement for Dogs, 120 Count.  After a couple of weeks, I noticed a marked improvement in my Boxer.  He no longer struggled at all to get up and the limp was entirely gone.  Since I began giving him both supplements, I've only seen him limp twice after waking up, and both times were after naps following particularly strenuous play sessions at the local dog park.I can't say for certain whether it was the Nupro, the Methylsulfonylmethane, or the combination of the two that did the trick, but I can say that my dog no longer shows any signs of suffering from hip dysplasia at all.As another note, both of my dogs absolutely love Nupro.  My Boxer would occasionally skip meals before I started him on this supplement, but since I did he has only skipped one, and that was on a day when he had an upset stomach.  The same goes for my German Shepherd.  They both vigorously chow down every meal now.  So I suppose Nupro could also work if you have difficulty getting your dog to put on weight.  To avoid a mess, I typically put the Nupro in their food, then add water and shake.  If you leave the food in powder form it tends to end up all over your dog's face.Finally, for all the good things about this supplement, it is quite pungent.

She also used to have a chronic problem with the hair follicles on her coat getting infected, which required washing with a medicated shampoo. Even then, she had a very poor coat with a moth-eaten appearance. Not a very nice look for an otherwise beautiful dappled girl!But we've experienced none of these problems since we've started the Nupro/Solid Gold combo. All three coats (two smooth; one long-hair) are full and shiny, and the only back problem we've experienced was a pinched nerve on my rambunctious boy, Ro, after taking a leap from our bed -- a place he had no business getting up to in the first place. Even that problem was short-lived, and he made a full recovery after a vet trip for a small run of anti-inflammatories.I highly recommend using a quality food and supplementing with the Nupro.

I know the day is coming soon when I'll have to make that tough decision, but I don't want him to live in pain for my relief. Until that day comes, if he can be in comfort, that's my goal.

Gave her two scoops of Nupro Joint, mixed with 1/2 tsp MSM crystals, and two crushed glucosamine/chondroitin pills and a couple cups of warm water once a day, and the effects were immediate.  Within a week the limpness and stiffness were completely gone and she no longer cried after an intense workout.  I now give her the same combo, but with just one scoop of Nupro.Not sure which of the three to thank for this (the Nupro has a bit of everything, I just supplemented the main ingredients with more of everything), but it definitely worked for my old girl.Another odd effect was that it (the combo) completely cured her occasional incontinence.  She has grain allergies, so we keep her on a very strict diet and it helps dramatically, but every once in a while, after swimming and drinking excess water, she'd have a little leakage.  Not a drop since she's been on these supplements. She did have am odd reaction to the MSM (I think) when I first started her on it.  Her hind legs got a rash and were really itchy after a couple days, so I stopped for a week, and started her back on very gradually when the rash subsided.

Finally, it gets very prickly as it gets chewed on, which makes it a little more painful when it meets your foot. But I guess this is a trade off for a durable bone when it isn't a rubbery material.So, overall we are happy with the bone. Our dog loves it (a little too much when we find it in our bed) and it has lasted a while. We'll probably buy another one when it's gone.

I tried Imodium, but that didn't help, so I went on the Internet to see what I could learn. I found out many cats are allergic to grains because they have never been part of a cat's normal diet. Cats are carnivores. However, commercial pet food companies load their pet foods with grains, especially corn because it's cheap, and it isn't digestible for cats. I also learned about everything else in commercial pet foods, including euthanized pets!! How disgusting! I researched grain-free cat foods and learned of the Wellness brand of grain-free pet foods, and ordered a case of canned food. The results were almost immediate! After just a couple of days on the Wellness canned food, my cake no longer has diarrhea and it has never reoccurred. On top of that, he loves the Wellness food, so I highly recommend this food for all cat owners. If you research the ingredients of commercial cat (or dog) foods, and you love your pets, you will never feed them commercial foods again.

So I wanted to switch from Tidy Cats which I found to be too dusty and has this weird deoderizer smell which progressively becomes less pleasant the longer it stays out. Having a limited variety to choose from, I picked up World's Best. BIG mistake. Honestly, it's not as though I was expecting this to be the best, but ironically it's probably among the worst. I understand all the hype about all natural products, but using corn as litter is probably the dumbest idea. When I opened the bag, I didn't expect that it it would smell exactly like grain. I wondered how something that smelled like that could possibly neutralize urine and feces odors, but since this product is priced higher than the rest and is obviously selling, I decided to ignore my skepticism. It has not even been 24 hours since I purchased this and I am absolutely outraged that this company has the nerve to sell an 8 lb bag for close to $10 and claim to be the world's best litter, when their product is complete trash.Here's everything that is wrong with this litter:-It smells like grain out of the bag and just smelled like grain mixed with feces and urine after my cat used it. I don't know how this has any positive reviews, but I noticed that some positive ones express that those who have issues with it probably have cats with very stinky excrement. Well, my cat is a tiny kitten whose poop is NOT overly stinky because she is fed the best quality food I can find. I just dumped all the litter into the trash, because seeing how it smells, I know my cat will stop using the box if it stays in there any longer. Cats are like that.-Many people expressed that this litter breaks down into a fine powder after some time. I already noticed that powder forming along the bottom of the box. This means DUST, which I'm guessing is the reason she had stopped burying her waste with the Tidy Cats. Plus she was sneezing all the time. That being said, in terms of odor, Tidy Cats is still a far better product and less expensive than this one.-This is perhaps the WORST part: When I placed my cat into the litter box after adding this litter to introduce her to it, she sniffed for a couple of minutes and I was horrified when she ATE a few grains. She was confused and thought it was FOOD! I can imagine how ludicrous it must have seemed to her to have to poop and pee in food. After I read another review about someone else's cat eating it, I gave up on the idea of using it up by mixing it with the new litter I bought (Precious Cat which sells a much higher rated 18 lb bag for almost the same price this one sells an 8 lb bag for).That being said, if I can't stand the smell of this litter, I'm fairly certain my cat can't. The main reason cats stop using their litter boxes is because of odor issues. I pay extra for odor control and if, after cleaning the box twice a day as I usually do, I still have to deal with odor issues, then this stuff is clearly a huge waste of money. So far I can't say much about the Precious Cat, which I immediately went out and purchased to replace this one, other than the fact that when I opened the bag, I didn't smell any funny odor or experience a puff of dust, and when I put my cat into the box she sniffed a bit and walked out as though there was nothing unusual worth investigating. If you can get to a Pet Supplies Plus or Petco, I'd probably buy that one as it's only a bit more expensive than Tidy Cats and probably WAY better (I'll soon find out). But the bottom line is, I would use ANY litter over this one.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Quite the misnomer", "unixReviewTime": 1312761600, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2011"}

It has a nice smell to it, is extremely soft and I don't notice any odor. When Garfunkel urinates in it, it doesn't clump and that section turns into a darker, maroon-type color until it dries up. Since he tends to go all the way in the back of the box in the same spot, by the end of the week I notice slight amounts of liquid residue at the bottom of the litter box when I'm emptying it, but even then, all the litter above it has returned to its normal \"dry\" color and isn't maroon like it was just used.I have a big litter box and just like with the Kitty's Crumble I use half a bag of this each week, scooping out the poo daily and dumping it all and using another half of the bag from scratch. Works well.The only real problem, as the review title says, is that this tracks like crazy. I live in a studio apartment and within a day you can see the cedar all over my carpet and kitchen linoleum. Also, if I'm in bed and Garfunkel is doing his business, after he rockets out of the box and jumps onto the bed with me the litter gets all over the sheets. He does have fur tufts on his feet though, so they tend to get trapped in there.This litter would probably be perfect if it didn't track so much. Otherwise, this is a winner.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tracks like crazy, but Garfunkel seems to like it...", "unixReviewTime": 1332115200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2012"}

I found this, use it in 2 standard boxes side by side, and I just love it.  On the *worst* day, the room where the boxes are smells like cedar chips:)  Generally, it smells like nothing at all.  I have a bad back, too, and really appreciate front door delivery and how light the chips are.  My youngest two cats favor these boxes, and one of the older ones uses it too.  I have noticed (sorry if this is TMI) that they urinate, not defecate, in the cedar boxes and use the traditional box and litter for the other...not complaining!One difference is that you end up pretty much changing out the litter completely when you deal with the box- for me, every 2 to 3 days.  The chips are light, so kitties may kick them out of the box but they vacuum up, no problem. This thing has lasted me for a few months, and I am a convert...if I could only get the other cats into it I would be the happiest cat guardian ever:)  Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wish I had found this earlier!", "unixReviewTime": 1330732800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2012"}

I've been using it for four weeks now and I haven't used up more than half the bag.  It smells terrific, it's soft, and the cats seem to like it.  But it does have a couple of drawbacks.  First it's very light which means it gets tracked everywhere.  I'm finding it all the way across the house on their cat tree.And then, it's red.  It's not blood red, and the color does tend to fade after some use, but at first sight it's a little unnerving.  You wouldn't like to look in your litter box and see brownish red, would you?  No, you wouldn't.  It also takes a bit longer to absorb liquids than I'd like, and I have to spend quite a bit of time turning the litter over to spread the liquid waste around.Odor control is very, very good, and the smell of cedar is lovely.

Neither cat is fussy about litter type.Pluses:-- flushable (my top reason for use, I don't have trash service)-- acceptable clumping (but I have never used the clay litters to compare)-- non toxic & no lung choking perfumes (I am bothered by potent odors)Minuses:-- cost-- to eliminate odor you must add an additional product-- for best results you have to clean box daily-- cost (it's a byproduct of wheat production that is likely swept up off a factory floor somewhere, wrapped in a fancy brand name and sold at TOP DOLLAR)Notes & Suggestions:-- I have found that the urine sinks to the bottom and sticks there. If I tip the box so the dry litter is out of the way, then I can scoop out just the clumped litter and any granules that break off. This helps to reduce odor.-- Every time after I scoop the box, I sprinkle baking soda over the top. I find that it sticks to the pee soaked clumps, so it must be replenished.-- I don't put new litter in every time... instead I let the level get lower and lower. Then at the end of the week, I completely dispose of everything in the box, wash the box with diluted bleach and soap, refill with fresh litter.-- Without baking soda, this stuff does small like warm bread that's been peed on... I can't imagine what the corn based stuff must smell like?! I have smelled corn based products (cat food, corn gluten fertilizer, chicken food & chicken poop which smells identical BTW, etc..) and they are revolting to me. Personal preference.-- I pour my bags right into a galvanized, sealed can. I have not had any problems with insects. Although I can imagine that it would easily be an issue if it is not kept in a sealed container.-- I did find evidence of a mouse getting into the litter box. I dealt with him, and do not have any mouse issues in my house. If you already battle with these creatures, it could be a concern.-- If I leave the box more than two days without cleaning, I do experience the gooey state of clumping. This litter was a COMPLETE bust at my sister's house. She has 4 cats, 2 boxes and doesn't like to clean on a daily basis.POSSIBLE CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE:--Today, when I picked up a new bag, and was griping about the cost and how cheap I am, the clerk at the feed store mentioned a cheaper alternative. Apparently they have a customer that buys chicken food, and uses that in her boxes. It's a grain based crumble that effectively works the same. The most compelling part being that 50# costs about $16.00, give or take. I got home, looked it up online and there are threads about how it works. I think I'll try that out next time.UPDATE, 3/21/2013:I tried the chicken food. It works the same. Zero difference in effectiveness and odor. Have found granules of \"litter\" that were in the cracks of the hardwood that were moth eaten...like those moths that get into flour. Chicken food is loads cheaper! I have more cats now, and other options besides flushing for disposal. I have switched litter completely. With the number of boxes that I now require, the insect and rodent draw is too much. Two boxes was fine, but with more it's like a buffet for pests, even with diligent cleaning.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Pluses & Minuses.....", "unixReviewTime": 1312934400, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2011"}

I ended up pouring the entire bag into their box and just cleaning it 2x a day.  Aside from the puke smell up close, there is no odor that spreads into the house.

Comparing Diamond brand vs. Diamond-made Natural Balance brand there are two main differences:Diamond is a larger bag for much cheaper.Natural Balance uses primarily Chicken, and then Lamb and Duck Meal. Diamond uses Beef Meal.So both use meal, but Diamond uses more/only meal. Is there a big difference? Probably not. Meal just means it's cooked and ground up. Most sources seem to agree that meal is not necessarily any worse than plain meat. What is bad is \"by product\", and neither food has this. Also bad are fillers like corn, which neither food has, either.I tried Diamond when I couldn't get Natural Balance on Prime and I needed dog food. The (substantially) lower price did not hurt. I knew it wouldn't be as good quality, but figured it would be good enough.One dog was fine with the Diamond. The other had seriously bad \"problems\" on and off for about 3 weeks. In fairness, he doesn't do well with any diet changes and had been eating Natural Balance for 9 years straight. I believe the issues were not because of the Diamond, but because of a change.

I even put it in a separate room away from their food so they would stop dropping their food in the bowl. But because paws still like to go in the water it still needs cleaned once a week and I dreaded doing it. If purchasing I would invest in some pipe cleaners because there are some hard-to-reach places - including the reservoir.Filters: For 2 cats a filter would last about a month, if I rinsed it when I cleaned the fountain. And when the filter becomes dirty all the carbon chunks sink to the bottom of the filter impeding on the water flow making it weak.

Genius! The water flow stayed strong and since the flow was circulating faster and stronger it keeps the fountain cleaner longer.

They have two fountains at my house.PROS:1. The cats drink more water because they seem to be attracted to the flowing aspect of the water.  Additional water consumption is good for cats and people.2. Since the water is filtered it is fresher and cleaner than a bowl of water.CONS:1. There are little crevices that are very difficult to clean.  I have resorted to using a steam cleaner to thoroughly clean the fountain once a week.  On a daily basis I use a small brush and mild dish soap.  Then I allow the fountain to thoroughly dry to eliminate any bacteria that were not removed with soap and water before refilling with water.2. Because the sides are low one of my felines manages to splash significant quantities of water out of the bowl as he drinks leaving a little river on the floor.  I have found that placing the fountain in a half sheet pan solves this problem but gives me something else to clean.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:1. I have not had any difficulty with algae in the bowl or feline acne.  This may to due to my fastidious cleaning routine.2. I have also not had any problems with pumps malfunctioning.  But I do take the fountains apart completely every day and clean them, including the pump intakes.3. I change the filter every month, just as I do for our household water filter.

The new Drinkwell has been wonderful because I've definitely seen all three of my cats drinking MUCH more water in the last two weeks than with the Petmate fountain.  I can promise you I've found the proof in the litter boxes.The Drinkwell's water stream is much stronger and circulates the water better than the Petmate. It gives the water the power to move most of the debris toward the little trap.  That keeps the water bowl so much cleaner; where as with the Petmate, the debris would circulate until it either sank to the bottom or stuck to the bowl walls.  In addition, the Drinkwell's filter is designed SO much better (6 divided coal sections).  The coal in the Petmate's filter would just clump at the bottom (i believe it has 2 divided sections).The Drinkwell also holds a lot more water.

I have two units in my house, one at either end of the house.My cat drinks from the top of the water run and my dog slurps from the bowl (dog backwash has got to be worse than cat backwash!).  Yes, I do dig out dog and cat hair from the intake/lever area about once a week, but that's a small task compared to washing and filling a couple of water bowls each day or worse yet, forgetting to fill a bowl or finding one completely empty and wondering \"how long have they gone without water\"? The pumps make enough \"noise\" when the water levels get too low, thus it's nearly impossible to allow a pump to burn out (nearly, not completely!).There is no \"slimy\" feeling to the bowl like there is in a standard water bowl (you know that \"film\" one often feels when cleaning a regular water bowl, despite the fact it looks clean?) and the large reservoir ensures plenty of water all the time (although I do keep a 1/2 gallon container nearby each one so I can just fill and dump directly into the basin instead of pulling out the reservoir to refill - I do the latter frequently, but at times I'm in a rush and a quick refill via the extra container does the trick for me.Lastly, my veterinarian noted my cat of 7.5lb cat  of 18.5 years lived as long as she did, despite being a tiny runt who had been severely malnourished and abandoned when I found her up for adoption at about 1 year of age, because he found cats drink far more frequently with these units which, in turn, keeps their kidneys filtering properly and, in turn, keeps the kidneys working well overall - kidney woes often being the fatal ailment of cats.The dog?  Well, for whatever reason, she simply will not drink out of puddles or the odd bucket or container - could be a lucky coincidence, but I can't help but suspect she's only known \"fresh water\" from the likes of this system and that's her preference - no icky puddle water ingested means less of a chance of parasites or similar.UPDATE 5/29/10 - I had read others complaining the units leak (other sites mostly) and alas, I am now among the growing cluster o' complainers.  Late the other night I heard popping sounds and much to my dismay (and total disgust) I found the unit had been leaking (probably about 3 days or so) profusely the entire contents (probably two full systems' worth) had soaked through the carpet and had severely buckled the original hardwood flooring to such an extent two planks are nearly buckled onto their sides (hence the popping sounds I believe). I had \"assumed\" the dog and cat were simply drinking more because the weather was changing and didn't realize there was substantial leak (never saw it, never felt it, but then I usually have shoes on) - looking back, I had noticed a very loud \"water fall\" sound had started with the unit (which some may like, but I found it annoying) and I discovered the section that fits atop the pump had a small split in it.  I didn't worry about it as it just meant that only 1/2 of the water was making its way up to the \"ramp\", but I should have inspected the unit more carefully as I would have likely noticed signs of the major external leak that was probably developing (although to look at the unit, empty as it is now, it's not like there's some gaping hole or visible crack in the base).Equally frustrating is the company's customer service option - no email, no contact via a Web site, only snail mail and a M-F phone bank that's routinely busy.  I've been a big fan of these units for many years, but given I'm not the first person to whine about major leaking problems, I fear the company is either cutting corners or is using defective/inferior parts.  The damage to the carpet is substantial - I had no idea mold would/could grow under a carpet in just a few days - but then I don't have experience with leaving a few gallons of water on it - the carpet can be replaced, not that I really have a choice now - but the hardwood is another story, as fate would have it, I found, \"they no longer make the plank sizes\", it's custom hardwood time - oh brother.

The point of having them is to provide running water, which cats like. Most complaints are about cleaning and noise. Cleaning is indeed necessary, much more often if you have more than one cat, and when new the parts are difficult to take apart. A little rocking of the top when taking the top off helps when new and eases with use. The bowl should be scrubbed with a mesh scrubber and a bottle brush helps get into tubes and corners. A rinse with diluted vinegar reduces lime scaling. Cleaning the pump is quick, easy and necessary. See felinediabetes.com/petmate_freshflow_cleaning.htm for excellent instructions and don't skip cleaning the impeller. Reduced flow is caused by either a dirty pump, which shortens its life, or a dirty filter. A clogged filter can also cause an overflow. Noise can be caused by not seating the pump carefully on the floor of the bowl after cleaning, but a rattling noise is just a sign of low water level. The pump is lubricated with water. If it runs dry it will burn up quickly. Just as with a plain bowl, water should be added every day. The reservoir should not be needed; it is a very temporary backup. This is just a machine, and it does take routine maintenance, but given that it will perform well for years. I keep a spare pump on hand; like everything, including us, it will eventually wear out, but replacing it essentially restores the Petmate to new condition.

It needs to be cleaned constantly.  The bowl part is too shallow and the water doesn't seem to move out of the reservoir correctly, and the water level in the bowl gets too low and the pump makes sucking noises.  The pump itself gets coated in slimy goo.My cats also prefer the actual waterfall the Drinkwell provides.  I've never seen them lap water from the plastic slide in the Fresh Flow.

Our vet recommended a fountain after Fiona, as a kittten, was plagued with a UTI and some related issues.  The price of the fountain was reasonable.  After spending over $1,000 on vet bills we decided that it was worth it to take a chance on the fountain.  Fiona and Ginger took to it immediately.  For weeks, Noodles, the oldest, would stare at it for long periods of time, and then go to the old bowl.  After watching how the other two use the fountain, she eventually became a convert.With three cats using it, the reservoir becomes nearly empty each day, but that's OK as we would replenish daily, anyhow.  It would be a problem if we went away for a couple days and had no pet sitter.  Each day when I refill the water, I squirt a small amount of apple cider vinegar in the area just above the slide.  (Using one of the pet med syringes, I fill to the \"4\" mark -- not sure if it's ml or cc.)  I think it helps with their health, makes their coats shiny, etc.Total cleaning is a project, which I do weekly in the winter and more often in the summer.  In the summer, more hair and goo accumulates around the edge of the bowl and, more especially, at the pump.  My cleaning \"kit\" consists of an old toothbrush, Dawn detergent, a sponge makeup wedge, and tweezers.  There are corners in the back part of the bowl, expecially near the pump, that are hard to clean.  Occasionally, using an old Water Pic attachment, I flush out the inside of the pump.  The first time, loads of black gunk gushed out of the hole, and a lot had accumulated in other areas in the pump.  Because the pump is black, and the goo is black, it was easy to overlook its existence with a fast, normal cleaning.Best news:  Since buying the fountain there have been no more health issues (knock wood).We'd buy another one, but would most likely see what else is out there that cleans more easily, and holds more water to make it better for three cats.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It makes Noodles, Fiona and Ginger happy!", "unixReviewTime": 1292112000, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2010"}

The product worked well and my six cats used it without any problems. The pump worked fine as long as it was regularly cleaned. The major drawback was that the bowl and its various parts were difficult to clean and even more so for me since I have well water and the mineral build up was particularly hard to remove. Then last week the electrical cord actually separated from the pump at the point of entry into the pump itself. I have several small and large water fountains which use pumps and have never had this happen before. But the pump did have some age on it so I began to search for a replacement. The original pump was a Jebao model PP-333-LV. However, the same model is now a different size and lacks the flow control valve. I checked the Jebao website, the Petmate website and many, many other websites in an attempt to find a compatible pump. I was successful only in wasting my time and elevating my blood pressure. The construction of the compartment for the pump is such that you must have the exact same size or it just won't work. It has to fit perfectly. I noticed that others who had commented on the same problem cobbled together parts from their old pump along with a new one with satisfactory results. I decided against this route and began to research other pet water fountains. After reading the comments accompanying each it became apparent that each had its own problems.So I decided to make my own. All you need is an aquarium circulating filter (I used the Tetra Whisper PF10, about $14), a large glass, stainless steel or ceramic bowl and some glass pebbles (optional). I had a beautiful antique crockery bowl lined in blue ceramic that was just collecting dust (5\" deep by 9 1/4\" diameter)which was perfect for the project because it has a 3\" wide straight band around the top, like a clay flower pot, which holds the clip-on aquarium filter straight up without any shimming. A large straight sided glass salad bowl would also work beautifully. I added some polished glass beads in the bottom to catch the usual debris and it works like a charm - so easy to clean. Google \"make your own pet fountain\" for detailed instructions. And the best part, my cats love it. I gave this product one star because it's hard to clean, I could not find a replacement pump which fit and Petmate does not have online customer service to answer questions.

Our vet also told us that cats drink less out of traditional bowls because their whiskers tend to hit the sides which is uncomfortable for them. The bowl of this fountain is wide enough to accommodate whiskers and therefore cats will tend to drink longer. After a day or so of being timid of the fountain, our cats took right to it. They are drinking probably four times the amount of water they used to drink from regular water bowls. The water trickling does make some noise, just enough to entice the cats and be soothing to nearby humans. It is so much easier to deal with than changing water in bowls twice a day; when the water gets low you simply pop out the reservoir and refill it. The water stays cleaner because of the filter.

My wife and I have six cats, ranging from longhair to shorthair to haireverywhere, and I am pretty sure they all drank from it.  They became accustomed to it very quickly, the youngest being absolutely fascinated by it.  The entire time, I also had a high-capacity gravity-fed waterer in another room, so it wasn't the only source of water being used.Most noticible is that the FreshFlow is almost silent when the water is topped off, but if the water level falls, there is a very discernable motorized-gurgling noise.  This goes away as soon as you refill the reservoir tank by removing the lid, pulling out the tank (which reminds me a bit of a gerbil waterer on steroids), unscrewing the cap, filling it up, then doing all this in reverse; a 30-second process.The gurgling happens every day, and I would rinse the unit every couple/few days, and completely wash the unit out once every two weeks.  I also changed the filter regularly, at least once a month.  Beyond this, I made a point of pulling cat hair away from the little plastic screen in the water bowl, well, all the time.

This can be a challenge since cats can be notoriously finicky or even lazy about drinking enough water.With this in mind, as well as keeping more water available during my frequent travels, I tried out this unit, was pleased, and bought an additional one.  After about a year, one of them started to leak through the joint whre the water flows through.  I replaced the unit with a new one that has not leaked yet.I've had three cats use them.  One loves the water fountains  best and drinks from them pretty much exclusively; that senior kitty can't crouch very well so she drinks from the top of the flowing part, while standing up. Another cat alternates between normal bowls and the bowl of the fountains.  A third one never used the fountains.For the people complaining about noise or burned out units, keep in mind this product uses a submersible pump (like in an aquarium), it needs to be completely immersed to function properly and to cool itself.  Letting it run dry makes it both noisy and damages the pump (after a while).  Keep it filled and it's fine.  The fountain will be noisy for 1-5 minutes when you first re-fill it, but otherwise it's just a quiet hum.Caveats:  It's hard to tell when the filters are gunked up enough to affect the taste of the water, and replacing them creates some added cost.  If your animals shed a lot, fur can get stuck around the pump and eventually impede water flow.  My cats prefer if I change the water in the fountain regularly (much more often than Petmate suggests).Other thoughts:  I checked with myP3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitorand discovered the unit only uses a miniscule 2W, less than most nightlights!For the price and the health of your animals, these are  a bargain.

My 1st one was the blue (discontinued color) medium size 50 oz.  It worked wonderfully.  It was quiet, unless it needed to be refilled.  It never leaked and my cat preferred it over the bowl.  She would always drink out of the running faucet.  I had to fill it every week or so.  The pump died twice, might have been my fault for not refilling the bowl as fast as I should of.  Overall I was very happy with it.  It lasted a year.  My only complaint was that there'd be a sludge, or slime that would occur.  Maybe from not cleaning it more often?  Also a lime build up (I think thats what it's called) where this dry white stuff would occur on parts of it.  People say you can clean it w/ vinegar, I tried but it wasn't a huge success it doesn't completely get rid of it and it comes back.So 2 weeks ago I needed a new pump and since the plastic was all nasty from the dryness on it, I splurged and got another.  Plus I got a new kitten on top of it.  I got the cream color medium size again.  Now with two cats I was filling it up daily, and it leaked every time it was filled.  Since I was returning it for faultiness.  I ended up looking around for a larger size.I found this one, cream color 108 oz large size.  I wanted to get the jumbo, just to not have to fill it that often, but I figure that would've been more for a small dog instead.  Overall I'm very happy with the size I got, it's twice the size of my old one and I've notice no problems.  I suspect it will have the same issues, but overall I'd rather have it then a bowl.  Just a note, try and not keep the food bowl next to it too close.  If you're like my cats and they spill into the bowl and then it just makes you clean it more.I wish that they would make an all stainless steal model.  I think my cons wouldn't be there anymore if they did.  And I wouldn't even mind paying a lot more for it.  I think the price is well for what it is.

I tried to switch my kitty over to super premium food - gradually as is recommended. Which is why it snuck up on me that this food was going to turn out to be a problem. While it was mixed with her old food she was tolerating it fine. She liked it by itself and had no trouble with it for the first few days. Then her poops starting turning really loose and she wouldn't touch it anymore. I tried transitioning onto two more super premium foods with the same results before I realized what the culprit was: one ingredient, flaxseed. All of the foods she had trouble with had it. The one super premium I finally found that she didn't have trouble with didn't have it. Flaxseed is known for greasing the chute so if your cat doesn't have problems in that area that ingredient might not be for you. It's amazing how many super premium brands have that ingredient prominently featured, which means I can't use them.

So I put one of those plastic rain bubbles over my basement window well and cracked one side of it open enough for the two boys (they are lifelong friends) to get into the window well. I put a plastic bag on the ground of the window well, then a fleece blanket and then the snuggle safe heating pad. I put another thin fleece blanket over it, and a round pet bed over the top, so the boys aren't exposed to the hot pad.These pads work great. I love it when I feed the boys and then see them snuggled in the window well, grooming each other. There is nothing like a post-dinner grooming session in a heated window well! Every winter night, I heat up a pad for 6 minutes in the microwave and then exchange it for the now-cold pad in the window well that I put there the night before. Very quick and simple. The pad does not get soft, but it definitely gets very warm. Do not handle the heated pad with your bare hands; use a towel or the cover that comes with it. Never place it where the cat would be laying with the hot pad up against his skin; always separate the pad from the cat with one or more blankets. BTW, I have started to not use the covers, because sometimes a little rain drips in the window well, and then I have a soggy pad cover to contend with, along with everything else that got damp.The pads stay warm for a long time.

But with two new dogs, it was time to get a couple more to make sure their dog beds were warm on a cold winter floor. I bought two more, plus extra covers, which you don't need because it comes with a well-fitting plush cover. The blue plush covers I bought don't fit well and in fact tore when I tried to put them over the heating pads. Some things to keep in mind when you purchase one of these:These are HARD. So it's best if you forego the covers altogether, and simply place them under a few layers of blankets, or like I did- in a bed that is two parts; the bottom part that sits on the floor, the second part is a pillow that fits securely into the bed. I put the snugglesafe between the pillow and the bottom of the bed, without the cover so it releases more heat up into the pillow they lay on. Because these are HARD, some animals will get freaked out by them, because it's obvious that something is there, as in the review that told about the barn cat who wouldn't go near it. You need to do as I said above, put it under several layers of bedding so they don't know it's there, or purchase a two-part bed that leaves the heat pad safely (and discreetly) out of their area.These get VERY HOT. You need to make sure there are layers of protection between your pet and the snugglesafe. (Again, as described above.)

Winters can be cold in Tennessee, even though this is a Maine Coon with lots of long fur. He has a styrofoam house lined with straw which will keep him warm and he currently uses it when the temperatures drop into the 50's. I wanted added warmth for him on those colder nights and thought this was a great item. I've heated the disk once just to see how long it remained warm. After heating, it's just slightly warm to the touch with the cover on. I sat it on my coffee table and seven hours later, only the center of the disk remained warm. 30 minutes later, it was completely cool. Whether it retains the heat longer if the cat is actually laying on it, I don't know yet. The cover that comes with the disk is very soft. The extra blue cover is soft, but smaller and it barely fits the disk. You will have to fight with it to get the disk inside and the cover does not completely close in the back. I do plan to order another SnuggleSafe so I can alternate them when the temperature drops close to freezing. So far, for the money, I'm very pleased with the SnuggleSafe.This is an update.

Cats, as obligate carnivores, don't need grain, and in fact--if you give them something with a lot of carbs, they will continue eating until they have enough protein.Since I switched my cats a few years back to this brand, both lost weight even though I feed them as much of this as they will eat. It completely transformed one of my cats. He was dumpy, overweight and middle-aged and since the food transition he lost weight and has become more active. His fur looks amazing! I also recommended this food to a friend, forgot I made the recommendation and six months later was over his house and said, wow, your cat looks amazing! He said, yeah, it's the food change we talked about.That said, the Wellness line is not my cat's favorite by any means. The reason is that it's like switching a person from potato chips and McDonald's to good healthy food. The supermarket brands such as Fancy Feast are filled with rendered fat, which smells great and makes cats go crazy. This has none of this, so they miss it. I transitioned VERY slowly, mixing the food they liked with a small amount of this and gradually increasing the proportion over months.Now, years later, my cat eats this with gusto--though, of course, if I brought Fancy Feast back he would go nuts again for that, but I don't. This is is his second favorite flavor after this one:Wellness Canned Cat Food, Chicken and Herring Recipe, 12-Pack of 12-1/2-Ounce Cans.The nice thing about this food is that, while he now eats it with apparent pleasure, my cat never overeats. I can give him as much as he wants/asks for and he stays the same weight. I'd say he eats an average of a half 12-ounce can a day, but it varies--some days he eats almost a full can, other days less than half. So essentially he self regulates, whereas with the kitty crack and dried food, full of grain, he overate.These large cans must be opened with a can opener. I buy them because they are a better value economically--the small cans of this brand are way expensive. Even this is expensive per ounce,, but if you actually do a calculation of dollars paid per protein this one stacks up just fine to the less expensive brands.  Which means my cat gets the nutrition he needs in fewer ounces.

Sure enough, an hour after getting it all scrubbed off, he was still very weak and tired but no longer vomiting or shaking.  I called my vet today to let them know that he was okay. I'm not bothering with Merial. I cannot understand why they would sell a product and advertise vet techs on staff and then have absolutely no recourse or help when a negative side effect occurs.

If it is applied after a bath, be sure your pet is thorougly dry.-The longer you use it the more effective it is, single applications are not nearly as effective.-You can still have a flea problem even after treatment due to the life cycle of a flea and timing of the treatment.  Best thing to do is to continue treatment in the meantime.-Also, you may see increased flea activity after applying Frontline.-Frontline is definitely beneficial for tickborne illnesses.  The tick needs to be attached for 36 hours before the pet can be infected, 36 hours is typically how long it takes for a tick to die after attaching to a pet treated by Frontline.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works great if you follow the mfr guidelines.", "unixReviewTime": 1317945600, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2011"}

I've used the regular Frontline, but find the additional control of the Plus version better suits our needs.  The tubes are easy to apply, but I always have difficulty removing them from the enclosure.  Since I've started cutting them out of the package, I've reduced the difficulty.  Our dog knows what's coming when she sees me pull out the package and she sits like a champ in front of me.  I part the hair on her upper back and gently squeeze the entire tube directly onto the skin.  I make sure that her bath is not scheduled for a day before or after the application and if the weather is such that she'll need to wear a sweater, I'll apply immediately after a walk to allow the medicine ample time for absorption before I need to \"dress\" her again in a sweater and/or her harness.  I wash my hands really well and dispose of the packaging immediately and sometimes wear gloves to protect my skin from absorbing any of the medicine.  I'm happy to report that we've not seen a tick or flea on the dog or around our home since using this product on any of our pets over many years.

I tried the Little City Dogs products last month (both the Capsar knockoff and the Program knockoff) and neither did a thing.  I didn't want to use another product immediately, so I waited a long month to buy Frontline Plus.I have used Frontline Plus successfully in the past, but the price gave me pause this time around.  I had also heard that the product was becoming less effective.  That does not seem to be the case for the fleas in my neck of the woods (and by neck of the woods I mean Philadelphia).24 hours after applying Frontline Plus one of my dogs was flea free and the other had slow-moving fleas.

I discard the extra in the vial.Important Notes:(1) Do not wash your dog for at least a few days prior to treatment.  The sweat in the hair and on the skin helps the product to adhere.(2) Do not wash your dogs for at least a few days after treatment for this same reason.(3) Read the box carefully, and return it if you see any red flags (i.e. product name on vial does not match box)Also, in response to the \"Buyer Beware\" posted on 10/15/12.

Whenever my dog got up there was a dead flea or two underneath the area in which she was laying.The only positive thing is, which I was unaware until my vet told me:Frontline does have a guarantee if for 3 months it doesn't prove to be effective then they will send an exterminator out to your house free of charge.  Just be sure to save your receipt proving you purchased 3 months or more.  Check out their website for more info.  I have not taken advantage of this so I can not comment on the experience....I just switched & was much happier with Advantix IIHope this helps!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Frontline Lost Effectiveness over Time", "unixReviewTime": 1376524800, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2013"}

The dog park is not sprayed and there is tall grass all over for bugs like ticks to hide in. We take our dog pretty much every day and I have yet to find a single tick on her thanks to Frontline Plus. An added bonus is that it's waterproof--I'm thankful for this because our dog has a new found love for puddles, mud, and wading in water. Needless to say she gets dirty and we have to bathe her often (especially in spring). As with any product that can affect your pet's health I would talk to your veterinarian about your options for pest control on your dog (make sure there are no other health concerns, allergies to specific ingredients, what type of area you live in--country, deep woods, city, etc.).

{"reviewerID": "A11FX8HL2ANK6T", "asin": "B00008DFGY", "reviewerName": "Peter Suslock", "helpful": [389, 420], "reviewText": "Allow me to caveat this review by saying out of 500 plus reviews this is the most difficult to write as I despise having to use pesticides on our dogs. That said, we live in Tick and Flea central, surrounded by deep woods and our bull dogs are in every sense of the word family. That said if you're reading these reviews your dog or dogs are your heart and using these products is a difficult choice to make, but for most of us it's one we have to make.On that note, it's nice to be among my own kind of folks and it's my hope the following information has some value for you.Frontline was first put into clinical trials in 1985 shortly after the discovery of it's active ingredient Fipronil. It has maintained the safest albeit not the most effective treatment for fleas and ticks. However, the more effective products pose a significantly greater risk to your dog.It's a slippery slope, but in evaluating what's best for your dog and offers the most protection at the least risk Frontline and FrontLine Plus are hands down, without question your best bet.Most tick and flea products contain Premethrin (or related compounds) as the active ingredient. Premethrin is a lethal neurotoxin that flows through the dogs circulatory system and flushes into every major organ - including the brain where it can do dire damage. Although thousands of dogs die every year from Premethrin and the FDA has mandated a minimal use of it not to exceed 750PPM companies continue to use it because it's cheap and effective.What makes Premethrin so dangerous is that it can't distinguish between insects and mammals including human beings. It's been known to be lethal to cats since the 1970's. Even a slight transfer from dog to cat can result in seizures, brain damage and death.Premethrin is volatile as well - meaning it's airborne properties pose a continued threat to all who breath it in - dogs and humans included.Frontline on the other hand uses Fipronil. Fipronil is an insecticide. Like any compound of this nature it can be lethal at too high of a dose. However studies including those from the Department of Environmental Conservation have determined time and time again that as long as the amount of Fipronil is at the correct dose for the weight and size of your dog toxicity is far easier to avoid and the product much safer for your dog.Unlike Premethrin, Fipronil is absorbed into the hair follicles and oil glands only.It is not absorbed into the dogs system nor is it volatile so you and your beloved pets and children can breath easy. The second active ingredient in FrontLine Plus is  Methoprene which is a long existing and time proven IGR (insect growth regulator) it's distributed exactly like Fipronil but only acts on flea and tick eggs and Larvae - this is important because it kills these vermin at the start of a new life cycle. What is more, the diseases that ticks carry now are infinitely more serious than the dreaded Lime disease - which for decades was the only concern.Competitors to Frontline (and some Vets selling other products) claim that fleas and ticks have become resistant to Frontline - hog wash. These pests have become resistant to most all pesticides and no independent research exists to confirm this claim. I can assure you I've researched this in the greatest depth.The bottom line is this - all of these products pose a risk.The wise choice is to minimize that risk in your effort to protect your pet from the diseases these vermin carry. Again, these diseases can be infinitely more lethal than the ingredients of the protection. To that end your safest and most effective choice is Frontline or Frontline Plus.In the event your pet has a bad reaction to Frontline products these are the symptoms you would see:* Restlessness* Itching* Vomiting* Difficulty Breathing* LethargyShould these symptoms occur, of course take your pet to your Veterinarian or emergency clinic immediately. It should be a comfort to know that unlike the toxic ingredients in most other flea and tick control products severe reactions to both Fipronil and Methoprene are rare. What is more they can be neutralized quickly.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Your Safest Bet For A Product You Wish You Didn't Need.", "unixReviewTime": 1345248000, "reviewTime": "08 18, 2012"}

And I love feeding it to them and here's why:1) It is MADE IN THE USA and contains NO corn or soy. The Lamb and Rice flavor is wheat free as well. Dogs can have or develop allergies to corn, soy or wheat.2) It is cooked in the casing for less nutrient loss and specially prepared and packaged without oxygen so that it will remain fresh at room temperature without the use of artificial preservatives such as BHA, BHT or Ethoxyquin.3) It is 93% digestible which means less dog poo and fewer cleanups.4) It is a complete and balanced meal, but it can also serve as a protein supplement when mixed with dry food.5) When cut in cubes, they make wonderful treats and training aids (yes, dogs find them that yummy).6) In a pinch (when I am out of Greenies pill pockets) a cubed piece can even be used to hide pet medications.Once you have sliced open the roll, you must seal and refrigerate the unused portion. I usually cut the entire roll into 1\" slices and then cube the slices.

Eventually I got a new Yorkie, a spunky spindly thing, that loves to eat but hates eating dog food. I tried different formulas of different brands, some expensive, some cheap, but mostly stayed with Purina One with the extra meat bits because my Yorkie and my Chiweenie enjoyed the meaty bits. However, once the meaty bits were gone, the dry kibble stayed forever and they would graze on it from time to time. For little dogs, this meant they were constantly needing to go poop.Enter Pro Plan. I picked this dog food up on a whim since I was already in a pet store. Both my dogs fell in love with the dog food immediately. They would eat their portion in one sitting. (Mosty, the Chiweenie would leave a small amount behind to snack on later.) My Yorkie, my picky eater, cleaned out his bowl - crumbs and all.What happened next surprised me.My spindly, springy-legged Yorkie filled out. I've been trying to get this dog to gain weight since he was a adult puppy. Nothing I fed him, from cheap to expensive, ever made him gain weight. I figured finally it was his natural genetics. He wasn't sickly or lacked energy, he just was a skinny dog. However, since he's been eating Pro Plan Focus Toy Breed Formula, he eats his full portion and he's filled out nicely so he's not so spindly anymore.Another thing I notice is that my Yorkie would vomit at least twice a week. This has completely stopped.As for my Chiweenie (a Chihuahua/Dachshund mix), who is built more like a Chihuahua style tank; I was concerned that she would grow fat with Pro Plan. Nope. Not at all. She's has stayed fit and trim.Another benefit: With them eating on a controlled schedule, I've been better able to manage their potty habits and have eliminated nearly all potty accidents inside the house.

Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they only need meat...in the wild they only get grains in the stomach of prey they eat. If you put grains in food, cats continue to eat until they've had enough protein. So the grain is just added calories for nothing. Since grains are cheaper per ounce, it's a great way to save the manufacturer money, but it's not good for your cats.In the first year after switching from dried food and lower-quality grain-filled wet food, both my cats lost weight and their fur became softer and shinier. The difference was most evident in my plump, dumb inactive cat; he lost a couple of pounds and went from middle-aged dumpy to sleek and active. He has gotten a lot smarter and is more lively in general.I also like that this food doesn't have any rendered animal fat or meat byproducts, which are disgusting slaughterhouse waste it is illegal to sell to humans.As far as how my cats feel, they think this is just okay. They would give it three stars for the smell/taste. They always prefer the cheap stuff, like fancy feast, because it is swimming in rendered fat which smells delicious to cats just like potato chips do to humans. I call it \"kitty crack.\" Cats choose food mainly on smell, not taste, which works great in the wild but not so much with commercial foods where their quality sensor is way off. To get my cats to eat this food at first, I needed to mix it with kitty crack--first only a quarter good to 3/4 kitty crack and gradually building up to 100% over about six months. It's never a good idea to get into a battle of will with cats...first of all, you'll lose, and second it is not safe for them to go more than 24 hours without food because of potentially fatal liver issues.After the initial break-in period, my cats ate this happily. This is the favorite of both my cats, followed by Turkey/Salmon blend as second favorite. I buy a variety to mix it up nutritionally and to make sure they don't get too fussy. Since they never overeat this, I simply feed them as much as they want...if they ask for more, I give it.One can is enough to feed one cat per day. This size must be opened with a can opener and stored in between uses. For this reason not as convenient as the 5.5 ounce sizes which you just pull open, but the cost difference over a year is substantial. It's not too much of a pain as on days that aren't too hot I leave this on the counter at room temperature between feedings. If for any reason it's not done by bedtime I put it in the fridge. Cat's digestion is much faster and a bit of bacteria in food is less likely to cause problems.Cost-wise, these are about $2 a day, and Amazon's price is competitive with big-box pet food stores. When I first started using this, the price seemed prohibitive so I took out the calculator and did a serious analysis. Compared with the Fancy Feast I was buying at a big-box store, per ounce this is a LOT more expensive. But then I realized that since Fancy Feast is packed with grains and junk cats don't need, comparing price by weight isn't fair. I redid the analysis based on daily servings of protein, calories etc. and the two foods turned out identical in cost. It would still be cheaper to feed dried food but if I'm going to go 100% wet the price of this is actually comparable to supermarket foods.Wellness also sells a Core brand which is even higher quality, but it doesn't come in the larger more economical cans, making it prohibitively expensive.Note: I read the one star reviews from here. Looks like there have been some quality-control issues with a new plant. I have not experienced this issue...the quality appears the same in the 4+ years I've been buying this.

I took her outside, set her down to potty, and noticed her back legs were NOT working at all.

How long the bag will last depends on the size of your dog and how closely you follow the recommended daily # of treats.

I even had a week in there where I forgot about my hip pain, which is really saying something as it's usually a constant.Now, I have to say in all honesty that I also had some Feldenkrais treatments around the same time I started this Zyflamend supplement, so it's hard to say for sure that all the improvement is Zyflamend, but I think at least part of the improvement is due to it, because I am absolutely shocked to not have my knees hurting after all the side to side jumping around I've been doing lately to lose weight.I'm going to take this stuff through the winter when my joints are usually worst, and skip it during summer, mostly likely. I think it is helping but is probably only necessary in addition to my other supplements when I am having a flareup of some kind.But if you're in pain or anticipating irritating your joints, this is a heck of a lot cheaper and less invasive than a cortizone shot, so I'd say it's worth a try.I always take my supplements in the middle of a meal, and with other reviewers saying they're getting tummy problems from it, I'd recommend doing the same if you take it.

We have used Zyflamend for joint pain such as when my husband broke his hip and later when his back sustained a compression fracture as well as for heart health - docs gave him 2 weeks or less to live due to Acute on Chronic Severe Congestive Heart Failure, Stage 3 and 4 yet we are on Year 4 and counting ;-), and we do not doubt taking these over pharmaceuticals and OTC NSAIDs these past few years also somehow played at the very least a minor role in his cure of Type 2 diabetes (18 year battle, no more!! ::happy dance:::). The herbs in Zyflamend are whole-food sourced instead of chemically altering the herbs trying to seek out one or two individual substances (think pharmaceuticals...).  Zyflamend is geared towards halting an over-active inflammation process. As the packaging states, undoubtedly Zyflamend can help with \"normal tissue growth, breast health, natural inflammation response, skin health, joint health, lung health, heart health, pancreas health, prostate health, and bone health.\"  We have found taking one softgel with two meals on the days it is needed has given us the best results, though they can be taken on an empty stomach (ginger undoubtedly helps in this regard.)Per the package:Serving size 2 softgels  Servings per container 90 (180 softgel size)Rosemary  150 mgTurmeric  110 mg (great anti-inflammatory properties)Ginger  100 mg (calms stomach among other properties)Holy Basil  100 mg (Tulsi - Google it..)Organic Green Tea  100 mgHu Zhang  80 mg  (Polygonum cuspidatum)Chinese Goldthread  40 mgBarberry  40 mgOrganic Oregano  40 mgChinese Skullcap  20 mgOther ingredients:  Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), maltodextrin, silica, yellow beeswax, and organic sunflower oil.

I have systemic lupus erythematosus with lots of inflammation issues. While zyflamend did not alter my inflammation markers or end my joint pain, I am continuing to take it and giving the product five stars. Here's why:Nothing I've taken has been able to improve my inflammation markers beyond where they are. With meds, my particular manifestation of this disease is stable and quiet but unremitting. So, unless something else comes along, this is going to be as good as it gets, and the fact that it didn't get better is not the fault of this supplement.Several friends of mine who have other inflammatory conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and IBS, have had really excellent results with Zyflamend, which, in theory, works on the same inhibitors as the prescription NSAIDs but has heart protective components as well. One friend was able to stop taking a prescription product that had, at one point, been taken off the market. The other didn't have any relief from her pain, but saw her IBS symptoms subside considerably. And a male friend felt that it helped his joint pain quite a bit and also seemed to help with frequency issues he'd developed with age.Everyone's different. In my case, my prescriptions seem to be what keeps SLE in check. But the SLE has caused cardiovascular issues in the past, and this supplement has a good dose of herbs that promote cardiovascular health. So, I'm going to keep taking it.Talk to your doctor, and give this a try. If it works for you, you will be so much better off than with the prescriptions and their side effects. If it doesn't work, at worst, you'll be better-nourished than you were before you tried it.UPDATE: I wrote this review three days into my second bottle of Zyflamend. While my SLE disease markers are unchanged, a pain issue I had from a car accident a few years ago has improved tremendously. I can turn my head and look over my shoulder for the first time in a couple of years. Yay!

My dogs did eat this food at first, and slowly began to not like it. After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!", "unixReviewTime": 1330214400, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2012"}

I also didn't want to feed my pets \"junk food,\" like the stuff that is mostly chemicals and corn meal. I fretted about this for a while until I discovered Purina One Beyond. Real chicken is the first ingredient on the list. It also contains vitamins and nutrients that my furry children need to stay healthy. Is it as perfect as certain other brands? No, but with this food, my pets check out in excellent health at their vet visits. They are maintaining a healthy weight, clean teeth, and shiny coats. And I can afford to feed them this brand. This is exactly what I need in a pet food, so 5 stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Mmm, cat food", "unixReviewTime": 1371513600, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2013"}

It is larger than I expected it to be, but I have an Akita, so that's okay.

The material is a very sturdy and reinforced material, which I like, and I simply stitched it up with dental floss, which is a nice sturdy medium to use.  Then, it lasted a few more days.After that, he tore a few more holes in it, so it is currently in my bedroom awaiting more dental floss.  A few of the squeakers in the feet have also been punctured and no longer squeak.The main thing I docked this toy for is not the holes, because my dog can certainly quickly make holes in plush.  I'm docking it for the fur...because the fur is just like threaded into a mesh, so the fabric is strong, but the fur pieces themselves can be fairly easy pulled out.  So I find these little fur pieces on the rug.  Also, there is a hanging loop on the top...I'm not sure WHY, I guess as a game...but it is unnecessary and probably should be cut off if your dog likes to pull on stuff like that.Overall, its a very decent plush, but will still get destroyed if you do not routinely repair it and keep an eye on it.

Because of his size, he can sometimes fit 2 or 3 smaller toys in his mouth at once and then follows me throughout the house, shoving them against my leg and squawking them all at the same time.  Yeah, it's sort of cute when first you see it; but the cacophony of noise eventually wears you down.This is where the large-size Homer is so much better.  At 9.5\" in length, the hedgehog's size insures that nothing else will fit in my big guy's mouth.  Homer is a mouthful.  I was looking forward to the groaning/honking noise since I find it a bit less wearing on the nerves than the high-pitched multiple squeaks of his other toys.  However, our hedgehog only squeaks and rattles.  It appears that we have a defective \"groaner\" in ours.  Too late to return it, though...it was already full of slobber by the time I realized its problem.  Still, he loves it.Besides the noise, the only downside of this hedgehog is the same problem that I have with many other stuffed dog toys...they're easily ripped apart.  My prey-crazy shepherd can be pretty rough on his belongings; so I usually thread a large needle with heavy-weight upholstery thread and go over the vulnerable areas of his stuffies before I give them to him.  Doesn't make them last forever, but it does make a big difference in their durability.  Fortunately, my pooch isn't an eater of toys or their stuffing, but he loves to find a hole and start pulling clouds of stuffing out.  Homer's main vulnerability seems to be his legs which needed lots of extra stitching.My shepherd isn't the only one loving this hedgehog, though.  Our tiny adopted stray cat, Goose, will wrap her front legs around Homer and kick him with her back feet.  Drives the dog crazy.  Goose is only doing it, I think, because she adores the dog and wants him to spend time with her.  In the meantime, the shepherd is gingerly reaching in to try to take back his hedgehog...and avoid the kicking kitty feet.

I feel a little bad about doing this to her since she used to be much more happy go lucky outside, but I am hoping with more time, she will relax. She has run through the boundary a couple times. She either runs back through it and into the house to cower, or runs to the front stoop to cower until someone lets her in. Everything seems to work fine. We keep the shock on a very low setting.

I did everything the movie told me to for the collie and I haven't had to put the collar on him now for about 3 months now! I used the same collar for my other pup and he also stays in the yard without the collar. It works great and we haven't had any problems with it at all. The only trouble we had was the collie running straight through it to get to the neighbors dog when I first got it. He got shocked but kept on running and once he got so far it didn't seem to shock him anymore. I think he had just forgotten about it at that time because he doesn't even go close to the line at all now. And for my lab, the training from the movie didn't work so well with him so I just had to watch him closely and let him learn on his own and it worked out just fine. The only thing I wish were different about this fence is that it had some way of letting you know when the battery is dying. I've had one incident where we had gone to work and our lab got out over the fence somehow but was too scared to come back over the line. So when we got back he was waiting patiently for us on the other side. Our guess is that the battery was runnin' low since we got new batteries and haven't had any trouble. And it would be nice to increase the intensity of the shock if it were ever needed instead of the width of the signal around the fence. But overall, I think this works great for a more timid dog that understands when it is doing something it shouldn't be. If it were used on a more stubborn dog then I feel like they would just take the pain of the first few shocks and keep running through like mine did when I first had it. But it is true to what the description says and for such a low price it was definitely worth my time and money!!! I would definitely recommend this product! : )***And as for the PetSafe 500-foot Spool of 20-Gauge, Solid Core Boundary Wire it works just fine with this dog fence.

She loves to jump the fence to run to my boyfriend's house to visit, which might be alright if I didn't have to worry about her getting hit by a car.  I did the training to show her what to do when she would hear the beep, then let her loose.  She got shocked one time, and it freaked her out.  She wouldn't go into the yard without me coaxing her after that for a few days.  Then little by little I was able to show her that she was safe as long as she backed off when she heard the beep.  I took off the shock prongs and put the rubberized ones on so I could be sure she wouldn't be shocked if she came into the house, as I do have a doggie door.  She felt safe in the house, and I'd read that there are electronics in the house that can set off the shock?  I don't know if that is true but I didn't want to take that chance.  I can now leave home knowing she will not jump the fence.  Almost two weeks later and she still backs away from the beep/flags.  I know she will figure out some day that she can get through the electronic barrier, w/o getting shocked, so the training may not be over yet.  We tried the double loop method first, surrounding my back yard, but that took away a lot of yard space for her to play in.  I just wanted her away from the fence, so we respliced with leftover wire going up over my back porch roof and around to the transmitter.  That works when I set the distance for the beep to go off on her collar about 2-3 feet from the barrier.  She can go right under the wire and enter the house that way.  I take the collar off her and shut down the transmitter when I am home, as she doesn't feel the need to bolt over the fence. (Separation anxiety?)  What's funny is that I got a second smaller dog to keep her company.  They get along great, but ironic that she would leave the little one alone to grow lonely instead.  Good product, so far, but I wish I could adjust the shock to a lower level, thus why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  I hated her reaction to the shock -- she was really freaked out!

(The best and cheapest ones can be found either at a local Tractor Supply company, or at the Tractor Supply website).  Its not quite as big or effective as either a squirrel deterrent or protection from the weather as a dome style, but it is certainly far better than nothing. (And a whole lot cheaper). The problem with the basic design of this baffle is the swing away system it employs. The same ineffective system that is unfortunately employed in a lot of squirrel baffles.  Even ones a lot more expensive than this one. The theory behind it is that the squirrel will lay down its paw on top of it with its full weight, slip off, and then fall to the ground as the baffle swings out of the way. Unfortunately this is one of those times when something sounds most logical in theory, but is a total bust in actual practice.  Squirrels very quickly figure out the baffles rational and set out to defeat it.  That is to say, they just come to learn to hang their feet from above and use the baffles swing away design to their advantage by it moving freely out of their way.  Just about everyone that has a bird feeder then sees the usual result.  A squirrel hanging down from above upside down feasting on and spilling your expensive seed.This baffle can be made far more effective by a simple redesign.  Just unscrew the two hooks that merge in the middle of the dome from above and underneath and screw in a lock nut so it is flush with the baffle on top and below.  Then screw the hooks back in.  The swing away design is then defeated and the baffle will remain stiff and very hard for the squirrel to move out of the way with his body due to the counterweight of the feeder underneath. Also, installing the nut stiffens the baffle sufficiently enough to prevent it from being tossed around by the wind as some other reviewers have mentioned. Trust me, it is very simple to do and it makes this very reasonably priced baffle most effective indeed.  I recommend this baffle if you're on a budget and desire something that works very well with the simple modification described above.

Unfortunately I've offered this product twice and it was tried for a mouthful and later ignored.  Interestingly, I also have a young cat (formal feral) and even this former dumpster-diver sniffed and walked.  I will continue to offer this and hope it catches on eventually.There are other products for the condition but this one seemed to be the most palatable from reviews.  There also seems to be some controversy over whether a cat in early stages of kidney failure should be fed a low protein or low phosphorus diet.  Further, there seems to be an issue in later stages with cats losing weight and not wanting to eat, and I am not sure if a food like this would encourage eating.  One day at a time.So here I am with the smallest amount one could buy (24 cans).  If this food doesn't get a decent reception soon, I will probably donate it to my vet's office for other sick cats to try.  If you've got an ill kitty, and you've been told to try a low protein/phosphorus food, it can't hurt to do lots of reading and try this, but no miracles in my household just yet!Update March 2010 - It's been 1 and 1/2 years since I wrote the above review.  Your vet advice and results may vary, but my cat has done very well on a normal diet since then.  After doing much reading and talking with our vet, special foods are not yet called for for my cat.  Have your cat's blood levels checked to see if they are doing ok with phosphorous and you and your vet can decide from there if food like this is advisable.  It may be better to discuss if your cat can stay on regular food and use a phosphorous blocker.More and more I am reading that weight loss is a problem for cats in kidney failure so keeping the food desirable to them could be a big deal.  My cat is having more issues with the accompanying hyperthyroidism than with the kidney disease currently, and while he has indeed lost some weight, his blood tests are showing he's doing pretty well.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "So far, no go", "unixReviewTime": 1217376000, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2008"}

They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer).

We have lint rollers that work well on our work clothing and suits, and our vacuum cleaner does a good job on the open wall-to-wall carpeting, but the trouble spots -- the stairs, room corners, bed comforters, couches and living room chairs -- were just very hard to get clean.Think that I need a physics lesson to really understand how and why this works so well... but am glad that it does.  This sponge makes those tough jobs so much easier. Yes, like anything else of value in this world, this sponge needs a little elbow grease in order to maximize its effectiveness but the results are well worth the effort.For example: We have sixteen steps with two mid-staircase landing areas leading from our second floor down to the first, all wall-to-wall carpeted. Starting at the top and working our way down the staircase, we 'comb' the stairs with this sponge and end up with a ball of hair as big as a softball by the time we get to the bottom... and that's after trying to vacuum the stairs first! Most of the hair comes from the sponge being able to lift it from all of the 90 degree angle areas that make up a staircase -- areas that the vacuum just can't agitate and lift from. The sponge as amazing at its job.Another reviewer noted that the sponge does not retain the hair like a sticky lint-roller does, and that this was disappointing to them. To the contrary, the fact that it balls up the fur instead of having it all stick to the spongy surface is actually perfect for our needs -- we just keep the vacuum hose nearby and suck up those golf ball size clumps as they accumulate every two or three stairs.Someone else mentioned that the sponge starts to become a bit 'pilly' and begins to disintegrate at the edges a bit... and I will confirm that this happens too, but it takes a while before it gets bad enough to consider buying a new one. We fully get our money's worth out of each one.At this great price there really is no way to go wrong with this product as long as you are willing to put in the effort.If you have a similar need to that expressed above, I totally recommend this product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gonzo Pet Hair Lifter - Great for this Golden Retriever owner!

I have a cat that will just eat and eat until he throws up.  I have the Bistro pet feeder which works really well but the minimum feeding is 1/4 cup which is too much for my cat at one time.  I have to feed only a few cat food pieces at a time several times a day.This feeder is much better if you need to control how much your pet eats at one time.  After figuring out the timer and through trial and error (user error), I have my cat fed on schedule with no chance of him overeating.There are 8 separate settings for the timer so you can use all 8 settings every day or whatever you decide to feed your pet.  The food comes out for the amount of seconds, or minutes you set it for.Seems to be solidly built and I've had no issues with it so far.  It's worked flawlessly.It's pricy but for my cat and his eating issues, it's worth the money to keep me from cleaning up after him every single morning when he overeats.October 9, 2013I have had this feeder now for 5 mos and I'm still very happy with it.  I have noticed one problem that is annoying.  Some of the food that drops out at the specified time, doesn't slide all the way down and ends up under the spout that drops the food.  It's the design.  It needs more gravity to slide down all the way.  I'm constantly scooping the food from under the spout area.  I might try to rig up some tube or something to carry the food all the way down to the dish.  Other than that, it's really saved my sanity.October 23, 2013Guess I spoke too soon.  Today the feeder just stopped working completely.  Just hums when the food should be dispensed.  I emptied the food out thinking it was clogged, but it's not.  It's completely empty and cleaned out but still doesn't work.  Just keeps humming and the wheel barely moves that dispenses the food.  I'm so bummed.  I am calling the company tomorrow to see if they'll take it back.  I'll update after.Dec. 18, 2013I called the company that makes this feeder and they sent out a new base right away.  However, the auger moved so slowly that by the time it started dropping food, the timer ran out.  It would only get 4-5 pieces out.  I increased the time and it didn't make much of a difference.  Also the food still gets bunched up under the spout so my cats can't get to it.  I called the company back and they're sending out another new base.  I did ask if it was refurbished and he said no, they are brand new and I must have gotten a defective one.  I must say their customer service is excellent. I give their CS 5 stars.

The most central problem was that my cats were constantly bothering me starting around 3am and begging to be fed...so using the automatic feeder, I could assure that the cats were being feed and that I was not losing my sanity. Additionally, having two overweight kitties (14-15 lbs), I found that after reading the instruction manual in regards to how to use timer to measure out feedings, 1. I could spread out the meals much better over the day to prevent them from gorging on food, and 2. I thought I was feeding them 1/2 cup per cat per day, turns out it was more...over the 6 months I used the feeder, they lost a combined 3 pounds.However, I have to give the feeder a lower rating because of the circumstances related to how the feeder seemed to mysteriously stop working. After using the feeder for about 6 months, I woke up one morning to two hysterical cats. Upon examination, it was clear that at least the timer had malfunctioned...I reset and reset it, as well as tried it on all settings to no avail, no kibbles came out. I didn't note any obvious problems with the feeder itself. I trialed it again with a different timer (essentially the same timer that comes with the feeder minus the seconds option), and noted right away that the timer was putting out the kibbles at a much, much slower rate, e.g. 1 kibble every 2-3 seconds. After moving some of the kibble, I could see right away that the motor was barely moving. In case there was some other issue in the feeder, I decided to clean the feeder and found no clear problems (although one very small, 1 cm piece of plastic that had broken off from somewhere in the feeder). Based on what other reviewers have mentioned, it is clear that the manufacturer has nothing constructive to contribute in terms of fixing the feeder.

The unit holds a ten-pound bag of dry food, which will last anywhere from a couple weeks to a month depending upon how many pets you are feeding with it-- much longer than the typical 2-6 meal automatic feeders which just aren't sufficient if you plan to be away for more than a week.Although this feeder costs a little more than the rest, it is worth it. The build quality was much better than expected, and the feeder comes with a long 8-10' jacketed A/C power cord, which should discourage your pets from chewing on the power cord.The unit uses an electrically-driven horizontal auger to dispense food. A timer controls when-- and how long, the motor is on. The auger doesn't turn very fast; for our two cats it has to run 45-60 seconds to dispense the correct amount of food for each meal. The auger motor is fairly quiet, though you can hear food fall into the bowl if you are nearby. The timer is a bit bulky (about 4\" square), and plugs directly into a wall outlet. The timer has two outlets on it- one that is timed (for the pet food bowl), and a spare outlet that is always on. The plug for the feeder fits tightly into the timer's outlet. At first I didn't think I liked the timer being a separate unit instead of built into the feeder, but now that I've thought about it, I think it was a great idea, because you can program the timer while sitting at the kitchen table. Also, the power cord only has power in it when the pet food bowl is actually dispensing food, so there is much less chance that your pet will chew through the cord and shock himself. Plus, with the timer located away from the feeder, your pet is less likely to paw at the timer and accidentally press a button.You can program up to eight \"on\" and eight \"off\" events, which can be set to daily, specific days, alternating days, etc. You will need to be careful when programming it though, to make sure that your \"off\" times are just a few seconds or a minute or so past the \"on\" time. Otherwise you could accidentally have the timer set to dispense food for several hours straight. You set timer events in weekdays, hours, minutes, and seconds, for both the \"on\" time and the \"off\" time for each event. A better solution would have been to set the \"on\" time, and then set the duration time (in minutes / seconds), but this is no big deal. You will probably have to experiment with the cycle times a bit to get them set so that you are feeding your pet the right amounts each day. For our two cats, we have our timer set to feed about every 4.5 hours, four times per day, for about 45 seconds each time, starting at 6:00AM and ending about 9:00PM. The timer has an internal battery, so I assume it would recover after a power outage, but I haven't tested this. There is a button on the timer that will cycle the unit between \"on\" (feed), \"off\", and \"auto on\" (timer) and \"auto off\" (??). You can press this button to initiate a manual feed for a few seconds if needed. You need to be careful when pressing it, though, because when you stop the manual feed, you should press it a couple times until the display shows \"auto on\", or else the timer will not automatically start the feeder. Other than the couple of quirks I mentioned, it's a great automatic pet feeder.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great product", "unixReviewTime": 1203465600, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2008"}

But the cable would circulate and nothing would fall into the dish. I tried different size dried food but it still won't dispense any food. I looked for clogs but soon realized the cap was preventing food from entering, it either won't open or does not open enough.

A bigger complaint is that it is hard to pick up. See, there is a hold for your hand in the back part right under the green lid.

It is possible to hold it underneath the latch, you just have to be REALLY careful. It's opened a couple of times even as I was being careful with it.

Latchman \"dogcentric book worm\"", "helpful": [26, 26], "reviewText": "I spent months searching for a food container to store my dog's food in. I could not find a container that fit all of my criteria. I decided to order this product from Amazon and see if it worked for me. So far, so good! I am very pleased with the item that arrived and here's why:- You can see the food through the container. At a glance I know how much food my dog has and when it's time to refill.- It holds a little over 30 lbs. of kibble. (I believe the last bag I bought was 33 lbs. and it fit perfectly).- Despite holding over 30 lbs. of kibble it takes up little space, which is important to me as I have a tiny kitchen.- The wheels on the bottom of the container make moving the container (even when full) around my house a breeze. Now I can scoot the container out of the way to clean.- The wide opening at the top of the container made mixing kibbles while switching brands of kibble easier.- Reasonably priced. In my experience, it is often cheaper than the food containers you can find in pet stores.- This container has done a fantastic job of keeping insects like ants out of the kibble. After losing $60 worth of kibble to an ant invasion, I REALLY appreciate this!- In addition to holding 33 lbs. of kibble, this container has no problem holding a 9 lb. snoozing cat atop the lid.The one downside I've found is that larger bags of kibble may not fit in the container **while still in the bag** due to the shape of the container. The big bags of kibble will get stuck a few inches from the bottom. If the bag is new and full the container may not close. So if you're planning on buying a 30+ lb. bag of kibble and you don't want to toss the bag, you might want to go a size up in containers. Otherwise, dump the kibble into the container and ditch the bag. (If you're worried about keeping track of when the food expires, try copying the expiration date from the bag onto a sticker. Put the sticker on the outside of the container.)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "This food container is exactly what I was looking for", "unixReviewTime": 1241136000, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2009"}

I had hoped they would discourage neighbor cats that seemed to find my yard irresistible.  To be honest, I didn't think they worked.  I'd see cats stroll right in front of one with no apparent reaction.  Admittedly I let them run down and didn't do a lot to clean them up or put in fresh batteries.  My gardener got them even dirtier and blew off one of the battery covers one time.  Contech was gracious enough to replace the cover at no charge since the unit was still under warranty.I got a feral cat coming in my yard roughly 4 months ago.  I tried everything.  Deterrents found on the web.  Red pepper flakes, ground black powder, coyote urine...I could go on.  Nothing seemed to faze him.  At the time I didn't know he was a feral cat--I thought he was someone's pet cat that was free roaming (a violation of the city ordinance where I live).  I contacted the city.  They could cite the owner but I had to find out who the owner was.  I talked to the neighbors where he exited the yard...neither owned the cat.  In desperation I bought a trap, finally trapped him (after trapping 2 other neighbor cats and even more scary a raccoon (who knew raccoons like catnip?)).  He had no ID and I found after having a vet scan him, no microchip.  I decided to take him to the local shelter (even though I had to pay $10 to do it--not to mention gas and time).  That's where I learned he was ear-tipped to indicate he was a released neutered feral cat.  I despaired that the owner would locate him, bring him home and release him again (which is exactly what happened).  The owners were very nice but couldn't figure out how to keep him home.  I offered to trap him for them if he would buy into the trap again but I'd learned he was very smart and would probably never get tricked again.  As I suspected, he looked at the trap but wouldn't take the bait.  Frustratingly I'd watch him come back to the yard, stalk and kill the birds I encourage to come to the yard.I decided one day after chasing him for the 3rd time that I'd get the Cat Stop devices, clean them up, dry them out and put in fresh batteries.  I did that and found on Contech's site that you could test to see if the device is working by laying it on its back and putting a pinch of salt on the speaker and swiping your hand over it to set off the motion detector.  I did that.  Salt didn't move.  I was convinced they were goners but I decided to put them out anyway.  I put them out along with fresh bait in the cat trap.  Sure enough the sun came out and here came the cat.  He walked over to the trap and checked out the new bait but didn't go in.  He walked past the trap toward \"his spot\" and suddenly stopped.  He stood for a moment...then turned around and went back across the yard and at some point went over the fence and left.  I was shocked.  That was the first time I ever saw him deterred from hanging out in his spot (which being a feral cat he thought was his territory and I was the intruder and nuisance).  I haven't seen him since.  I don't know if feral cats are more sensitive or if the concentration of two units in a small area increased the discomfort or what.  I'm just EVER SO grateful that they finally did the trick.  Being the cynic that I am, I keep looking out, expecting him to figure out a way to deal with this new addition to the yard...but he hasn't come back.I tell this long story to encourage others with a similar problem to try this product.  I really didn't think it was doing much of a job but the Cat Stop unit is the ONLY thing that ever stopped this cat.  I know something like a nuisance cat taking up in your yard and killing your birds should not make a person as crazy and stressed as this situation did me but it ate at me like a dripping faucet.  Many people encouraged me to do harm to the cat or at least once I trapped him to take him a long way from his neighborhood to a farm or out in the woods and dump him, but I couldn't do that to someone's cat.  As much as I grew to hate this cat for making my life miserable, I can't harm a cat--barring him attacking me.  This cat wasn't aggressive or destructive--he just felt my yard was his turf and I was an annoying creature who wouldn't quit bothering him.  I'm so glad we could both have peace in the end.

I own four of these mats in total, in three of the different sizes. I consider it a training AID and a tool that gives me a few extra seconds to help my pet when it needs a reminder of what the rules are and sometimes a few seconds is all you really need.First, I am new to being a cat-mom and the lengths that a young cat will go to in testing and RE-TESTing its boundaries will probably never cease to amaze me. At 11 weeks it was the war of chewing cords; I used the ScatMat in a hallway to keep him on one end of the home while I kitten-proofed all the cords on the other end then switched. At 15 weeks he became nimble enough to jump up on the kitchen counters in one leap. Butt surfing on my formica and eating out of the sink are two things I'd rather he not have as habits. Also, if he could reach the counter that meant the stove COULD be next! This counter size ScatMat was ordered the next day as well as a special cover for the stove.The cat, btw, has since decided that the ScatMat will NOT Have the last word on where he should be allowed to roam; the little guy spends a decent amount of time EVERY day sitting near the patio door in front of the mat, walking around the mat, crouching ever-so-near the mat, and appears to be intensely engrossed in figuring out how to outsmart the mat! So far, the mat is winning but with this amount of intense daily contemplation I wouldn't bet against the cat.My dog, a 15lb doxie-poodle mix has always been well behaved and I have no need for the ScatMat as far as he is concerned. I did have to place a mat in front of a patio door to keep the kitten inside the house though and the dog quickly and easily figured out that he needs to approach it from the side and just leap over the corner. If you are buying this to keep a small dog contained I should mention that I did not work long and hard on training my dog to outsmart the mat, I just put on his leash and said, \"let's go\" as I always do when it's potty time and he navigated right around it and followed me out the door. I don't know for certain if he has ever activated the mat since he walks very quickly and the mat needs a second or two with two contact points to trigger the response. He does seem to know there's something to be a little wary of with the ScatMat; he avoids it, so it's possible his curiosity got the best of him when I wasn't looking. Point being, it is very easy for my little guy to get around or over the mat.In the end, this mat helps me to keep the kitten off surfaces in the kitchen and helps keeps him indoors where he should be.

Arm & Hammer Super Scoop was the first one I tried. I gave it a good run (probably six months) but had to give up.Let me tell you a little bit about the way I use kitty litter so you can judge for yourself whether this product will work for you. I have four cats and four litter boxes. Naturally, all the cats want to &#34;go&#34; in the same box, but that's beside the point. I use 3 or 4 20-lb boxes of kitty litter to fill the boxes after I scrub them. I scoop regularly until the level of litter in the box is low. Then I'll top off with another 20-lb box. When the litter gets low a second time, I go ahead and do a full cleaning. This process usually completes itself on the order of 3-5 weeks, with my cats.I did not find the Arm & Hammer to be too dusty, and I did not find it to have a scent (which is good, since it's supposedly unscented). And for the first couple of months, it was serviceable. But I noticed a change in the quality a couple of months in, and it never did resolve itself. I don't know if they changed the formula or I got multiple bad batches in a row, or what, but the performance of the litter took a turn for the worse and never improved.What happened was my house started smelling like cat urine, whereas it never had before (following the exact same procedure outlined in an earlier paragraph). At about the same time, I noticed that the litter stopped clumping after awhile or, occasionally, the clumps would break apart when I scooped (into pieces small enough that a normal scooper wouldn't actually catch them). So every time I scooped, I was essentially spreading the urine litter all around, rather than removing it. At first, this only happened after I did the refill (as described above), but later, it started happening even with freshly-cleaned boxes. The odor control capabilities of the Arm & Hammer litter were lasting a very short time, and I eventually had to give up on using it all together, as it was just not economical to buy 80 pounds of the stuff every week.Note: If anyone has tried this recently, since I haven't used it in over a year, and has noticed that the quality has improved, please let me know.

Our wire-haired fox terrier always has to \"have the last bark\" with neighboring dogs (typical stubborn, willful terrier traits) -- this behavior has dramatically improved.  The device works well within these paramaters:1) For our yard configuration, it's a \"line of sight\" type of device -- depending on the size of your yard, it may not impact your neighbor's dogs, random wandering bands of dogs, or your own dog if s/he is too far away (such as around the other side of the house).  It has a very long cord, so I move it around every week or so, and the dog hasn't figured it out.2) It doesn't stop barking, it interrupts a barking sequence -- for it to work, you dog has to be repeatedly barking.  It appears to distract the dog, taking the steam out of the barking episode.  The device doesn't prevent all barking, and the dog has to get going on a string of repeated barks for impact.  But, it does interrupt the cycle, and shorten the cycles for my dog.  She may bark once or twice, then kind of give up - she has a weird \"half bark\" when the tone goes off, and then it's pretty much over.3) It doesn't put a big dent in \"barking for a cause\" - such as a brazen cat wandering along the fence top, taunting the dog.  When there's a good reason (in dog logic) to bark vigorously, my dog is unfazed by the device, initially.  She does seem loose interest in the barking sooner, though.All in all, happy with the purchase, and would recommend.Update February 2013 -- still working!

I can hear it all the way down the sidewalk at the mailbox, which is around a corner from our unit, so...yeah. For our neighbors, that's got to be as bad, if not worse, than the actual barking.However...it has really helped us curb his nighttime barking. He's barking during the day because he's worried we're not coming back, so just a noise-maker won't contain that, but he barks at night to get our attention or tell us he's bored, and for casual barking like that, he doesn't seem to find barking worth the obnoxious noise he'll have to hear. He will still bark when he's in his crate and needs to go to the bathroom though, because that is worth it to him, apparently, so that's actually pretty successful, and just what we wanted.So, we need a better daytime barking solution, but it's helpful for overnight.

{"reviewerID": "A3U7HTT0PO0IAO", "asin": "B0001VJD6A", "reviewerName": "Frugal Ant", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "First off, my dog (85 lb German Shepherd) has pannus. The purpose of doggles is to protect his eyes from UV light so that he doesn't go blind. I could care less about the coolness factor, this review is strictly based on the ability to protect my dogs eyes from the sun, and his comfort in wearing them.Second, I'm writing the same review for all the doggles, as a comparison, so you don't have to go looking through my other reviews to see how well the other types of doggles worked, or didn't work.Third, I only make my dog wear them when it is sunny or overcast outside. I generally try to take him for walks/runs when it is either early morning/evening, or cloudy days. But he's full of energy, so I have to take him out on sunny days. This is when he wears doggles.With the disclaimers aside:1st choice:  Doggles Mesh EyewearI only recently tried these, and wish I had tried them sooner. I think what kept me from buying these is that in the photos, it appears as if your dog is not able to see through these, and because it only protects from 50 to to 60% of UV light. After spending ridiculous amounts of money in search for the perfect eye protection on every kind of doggle out there, this has become my first choice, though still far from perfect.My dog can see very well with these, tolerates these the best out of all the other doggles. Will play with these on, and even chase a ball if other dogs are around chasing the same ball. I have noticed that sometimes he can't follow the toy as well, but that seems to be based on how fast the toy is flying and how high I throw it. So I still have to change how I play with him, but at least now he will play with eye protection on, which is huge.The mesh is very light, which is why I think he doesn't mind it. It is kind of awkward looking as the mesh has pointy ends that cause it to stick out and not be laying directly on his eyes. I had my dog wear these for a full day once, and when coming back inside, I noticed he didn't rub his eyes against the couch as much as he does with other doggles.The only reason I can't give this five stars is because it is only 50 to 60% uv protection rather than a 100% as offered with other doggles. This is a concern for me as the UV rays can really damage my dogs eyes due to the pannus. However, since my dog doesn't try to take these off anywhere near as much as the other doggles, I feel he gets a lot more protection from these since he actually keeps them on.Since trying these, I have bumped down the ranking on the other doggles as noted below.1st and 2nd choice: Doggles Large K9 Optix sunglasses, framelessThese are by no means perfect, and I fear the day they get broken. So far they have lasted several months with taking extreme good care of them. The reason they are one of my top choices is because they are 100% UV protection and my dog minds them the least (with the exception of the mesh doggles which are half the UV protection). I think what he hates about most doggles is that they have a bulky and heavy frame (from a dog's perspective), and they are not one lens, thus making them heavier on his head, and reducing his visibility. With these frameless doggles he does generally well, and is only intolerant of them when he's bored. He doesn't try to take these off as much, and as long as I have him distracted (going to a new place or chasing a critter), he doesn't mind them. He will more often than not play ball or catch a Frisbee with these on, but sometimes not. I wish I could give these five stars, but they are flimsy, and will fall apart eventually. I gave it four stars simply because they have held together thus far, with extra care. What really made this my top choice, is that they are frameless. I can see a huge difference in how my dog sees through these doggles in comparison to other doggles. So this gets first place simply for his comfort in vision. The straps fit nicely behind his ears and under his chin. If only they were made a little more sturdy...I am making these both my first and second choice because the mesh eyewear only offers half of the UV protection that these do, and I can't use the mesh eyewear on really bright sunny days due to lack of the UV protection.2nd choice: Doggles OriginalZThe doggles originalZ only come with one color lens, which really isn't a big deal, but I have learned that even on overcast days, my dog needs eye protection, and he's less tolerant of these on overcast days versus on very sunny days. I think the darkness of the lens may reduce his visibility. He tries to paw his doggles off more so than with the frameless pair, but he minds these less than the ILS doggles. Overall, I'm happy with these because he does do fairly well with them when distracted, but I can tell he dislikes them. He usually will not chase a ball or Frisbee with these on, especially if there are other dogs around. I think he can't see the ball/Frisbee as well, and other dogs can, so he just gives up. Unless we're doing something new and exciting, he generally will find a shady spot, lay down, and watch the world play around him. It's sad to see him this way, but going blind will be worse for him, so I keep making him wear them. The doggles are well designed with the strap that goes behind his head and under his chin, which is easily adjustable, and vent holes on the sides of the doggles so that his eyes don't sweat/fog up.3rd choice: Doggles ILSI started out with the ILS doggles since they were the newest doggle out, and I liked the idea of the interchangeable lenses. I tried several colors of lenses, and found that my dog minds the brown lenses the least. It is nice to be able to remove the lenses that are scratched up and replace them with shiny new ones, and it's also nice to put in the clear lenses for overcast days when I want my dog to be able to see more, with the darkest lenses on really sunny days. So why not my favorite doggle? The dog hates them. The design is almost the same as the originalZ, with a few differences. The straps seem about the same as the originalZ, and the vent holes only differ in shape. The nose piece seems to be further apart than the originalZ, and even though the frame, when compared to the originalZ when not on, seems the same, they are a lot bulkier when on. I also found the foam that is between the doggles and the dogs eye is a little different, and seems to fall apart easier than the originalZ. The doggles company actually was kind enough to throw in some free foam with my latest order, but even super gluing it didn't seem to hold it well in place. Because the ILS doggles are much bulkier than the originalZ, and the dog hates bulky things on his face, he tries harder with these than any other doggles to get them off. Often, I find him running back to me with his doggles all distorted on his face with the straps all tangled. I have no idea how he manages, but it's sad to see him running back to me for help to fix his doggles, which I'm sure he's hoping I take off. No way would he even consider chasing a ball or catching a Frisbee with these on.Last choice: Doggles K9 Optix Blue Rubber Gradient Frame with Smoke Lens SunglassesThese are almost frameless, top of the frame is very thin, so my dog didn't seem to mind them as much, however, they broke within a week, even with very careful use, and constant watching of my dog so that he doesn't paw at them, and taking care to put them in a safe place when not in use. These were my favorite except for the fragility of them, until I found the frameless.Okay, for those designers out there that want to make the perfect doggle, I hope you are reading this. You need a single lens doggle that is still very durable, sturdily built, and not too bulky. Basically, a single lens across both eyes, with a very light frame if any, such as the mesh with a softer plastic that is still 100% UV protection. Dogs are not human and do not see like humans, so why only create something that works for humans is beyond me. The frames in between the eyes are bothersome to the dog, and the bulk of most doggles (especially the ILS) causes discomfort. I actually bought a pair of ski goggles for humans and ended up sewing a chin strap to it to see if that would work, but it was too bulky and he was able to get them shook off by just shaking his head. But I could tell that his eyesight was just fine with the single lens.Lastly, when back inside and we remove the doggles, my dog immediately runs to the couch and rubs his eyes against it, which we talked to the dog eye specialist about. It was suggested, that after wearing doggles, rather than let the dog rub his eyes against objects, that we put icepacks on his eye area.

Medium is the right size.  The foam padding on the frame is decent but the glue is not.  I have to peel off the foam every time I buy a new pair (which is easy to do, and which should NOT be easy to do) then re-glue it back on using high-quality glue.  Once properly glued to the frame, the foam works well.Then there's the straps.  Very difficult to get these adjusted right.  Too loose and the doggles get blown back off his eyes and up onto his head.  Not good when you glance over at your dog at 65mph to discover he's got no eye protection!  Too tight and they become uncomfortable and the dog starts pawing at them.  Then once you get them just right, well they won't stay adjusted--they \"self-loosen\".  The solution to this problem is to salvage an extra tri-glide slider from one of your old Doggles and use this to double-up the sliders on the head strap of the new Doggles.  With two sliders the strap won't self-adjust.The other thing about the straps is that the neck strap is sewn in place on the left side but it's loose on the right side, so this strap keeps wanting to work its way back along the head strap towards the ear.  It doesn't have to go far before it stops doing its job and the Doggles get blown upwards off his eyes and onto the top of his head.  Luckily, the solution to this problem is the same as the other strap problem.  When you add the 2nd tri-glide to the main strap you can position it to \"trap\" the neck strap up against the frame.  That way both sides of the neck strap are anchored where you need them to be.  This strap still seems to \"self-loosen\" but it's way easier to adjust the length on this strap than on the head strap (after adding the 2nd slider).You might ask why I even use Doggles when they are so much trouble.  Answer--because there's nothing better out there.  I've tried quite a few.  Maybe if my dog had a different shaped head and snout I could use human goggles, but he doesn't.  The Doggles actually fit his face perfectly.  It's just getting them to stay put and be comfortable too.  Bear in mind that my dog and I often put in 10 to 12-hour days on the bike, we ride 60+ mph roads fairly often, and he's taller than the windscreen so his face is exposed to the full blast except when he lies down to snooze.By the way, if you are considering the original Doggles instead of the ILS Doggles, they have the same problems with the foam and the straps.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Needs improvements for sidecar dog", "unixReviewTime": 1372118400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2013"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "There are 2 main components of this system: the transmitter and the dog collar. The transmitter emits a radio signal that's picked up by a receiver in the collar. Whenever your pet goes too far, the collar device first produces some warning sounds, then administers the dog an electric shock. The intensity can be controlled, on a scale of 1 to 6. You also get a bunch of flags that are supposed to be visual clues for the dog during training.I titled this review 'reliable' because we've had one of these transmitters for about 4-5 years and, after we plugged the transmitter in and set the range to the 'max', never had to revisit it. As for collars, we started with one, for one dog. We had to replace it after a couple of years because it stopped working. Since then, we bought 1 more because we have 2 dogs now.To make it short, on our 2 puppies, we had no need to study the manual, plant little flags or any other training clues. Our training lasted about 30 minutes. As soon as they got zapped a couple of times and learned to associate the warning tone with 'run toward the house', they were fully trained. End of story.My issue problem with this system is the range. Yes, I know, that I can buy 2 transmitters and therefore extend the range a bit but, at these prices, I can't afford to do this. All I wanted was to be able to extend the range from the current about 70-80 feet all around to maybe a 120 feet radius around the transmitter. Somehow, I think this should be quite possible.Oh, the new collars require the somewhat expensive but a lot easier to install PetSafe batteries.

Beck \"BeckImpressions\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "So, I've always been against &#34;invisible fences&#34; for dogs because I don't like the idea of some mystery beeping and zapping that they can't see coming, and I don't 100% trust them to keep a determined dog in his space.  Then I got the opportunity to analyze how this model worked out for a neighbor.  And then I had no choice but to try it with my own rescue baby.  Here are their stories...The neighbors have a male boxer, and they began training him on this system as a young puppy.  They keep him outside at all times (which I hate!!), but for the most part, the system seems to work to keep him safe in his yard.  He's also right between 2 very busy roads (which makes me extra nervous), but he manages to stay in bounds 95% of the time.  The times he has left bounds were when he was desperate and his battery had stopped working. Most times he doesn't even go close to the actual bounds, so he never hears the beeping, but this one day, his owner was next door, and the dog really really wanted to be with him.  He went for it, and he never got beeped or zapped because the battery died.  NOTE:  THE BATTERIES DIE QUICKLY WHEN THEY'RE ALWAYS ON, SO CHECK THEM FREQUENTLY!!!!!  The other times he has left his bounds, suffering the zapping, were on holidays with fireworks (4th of July, New Year's Eve).  Seriously, if you have a dog, keep an eye on it during fireworks, or keep them very safe inside.  They'll be scared inside, too, but at least they'll be safe.  One of the worst problems with this poor dog being on this system 24/7 is that he has a huge furless lump on his neck where the metal things jab him.  For the record, the warnings/instructions say not to leave the unit on your dog for longer than 12 hours at a time, so I fault the owners for leaving it on him all the time.  Also, surprisingly, the metal things don't seem to bother the dogs (at least not boxers), even if they look uncomfortable to me.  This boxer doesn't even seem to mind his huge lump, but I'm very disturbed by it.All that said....  I then rescued a boxer, about a year or two old when I got her.  She had been living in a foster home with a fenced yard, so she was used to having freedom to run around with fenced boundaries.  Unfortunately, my home doesn't have a fence nor any way to fence it in.  I stressed so much about how to give my dog freedom to run around, but still keep her safe within the boundaries of our yard.  Plus, training a year old dog can be tough.  A wireless fence was the only option I could come up with.  She's very much an indoor dog, but she goes outside to use the bathroom and play.  Training her on this system was a little difficult at first.  She didn't know what the hell was beeping (and then zapping), and she would often run off the wrong way, even after trying to train her with the leash to come back towards the house.  She didn't like it (even the beeping) at all!!  Within a couple weeks, she was full on paranoid and didn't want to leave the porch because something in the grass was evil and out to get her.  It took her a while to get comfortable with the yard again, and she would relapse to the porch if she heard beeping.  That's kind of good that she would come back and stay close to the house, but it defeats the purpose if she isn't running around getting exercise in the yard.  After some more time, we actually stopped using the collar on her (which she never associated with the beeping or zapping), and she eventually got used to the yard.  The good news, and I'll credit this system, is that she did learn to stay in the bounds of the yard.  No specific bounds, and she actually doesn't go as far around the yard as she can.  But basically, it did what I needed it to do.  Even though I don't use the system anymore, I feel like $200 was a worthwhile investment just to train her to hang out in the yard.  I still keep an eye on her when she goes outside, because I don't trust anything 100% to risk her one day running out into the road, but I'm not afraid to turn my back on her for a few minutes while she's out.One of the bad things about this system that my dog is still suffering from is that so many things beep!!!  She's getting used to the microwave, but the Playstation has a similar beeping sound, and there are way more beeping sounds on TV than you'd ever normally notice until your dog jumps up and runs.  Poor little girl is traumatized.  I think it would be worse if we were still using the system with her in the yard.  So, just keep that in mind.Also, as noted above, the batteries die quickly, especially if you leave the system on all the time.  Even when we were only using it for her to go outside a few times a day, we still left it on because it was in a back room.  Luckily, replacement batteries are cheaper than I expected, but still.  Keep an eye on the battery power left, and always have a fresh battery on deck to replace a dead one right away.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Interesting results...", "unixReviewTime": 1390521600, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2014"}

Has the range it says it has, but like other reviews said, a lot of things affect the boundary and it can vary slightly day by day. For us,that isn't a problem as the boundary is always off the lawn I the wooded area,so it trains our two dogs to not venture off the lawn.I have two concerns about it. The first is it randomly goes off. We can be sitting on the deck about ten feet from the base unit and one of the collars will go off shocking a dog. They can be playing within the good area and the collar will lose signal and go off. We have two collars and both do it. Our two-year old shepherd is very skiitish when we put the collar on her now. We've taken to putting collars on them only if they are out alone and they come off immediately in the house. The second issue is the extra collar. The one that came with the system was excellent. I returned our first extra one because it was terribly difficult to set. The replacement is a little better but not like the one that came with the system.We'll continue to use this for the lack of a more practical way to keep the dogs from going into the woods on their own when we let them out for bathroom breaks, but I'm not thrilled with it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I really really want to love this, but can't...", "unixReviewTime": 1398384000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2014"}

The mother of the puppy was notorious for getting out of her yard and roaming the neighborhood to \"visit\" everyone.  Unfortunately, she taught the little princess how to do this at the tender age of two months.  So when she came to live with us, it took her no time to scale the back fence and start roaming the neighborhood with her mother again.  I can't even begin to tell you how dangerous and frustrating it was for us.  Every time she was let outside, even with one of us there to supervise, she was running to the back fence and would be gone.Instead of getting a new fence, we decided that we would give this a shot.  I felt bad about having to use it, but we felt like it was the most economical option for us.  The other dogs don't ever try to leave the yard. The first day we purchased the system, we placed the flags all around the back yard and put her on a leash.  We then slowly walked her towards the containment field and let her hear the beep.  We then said no and pulled her back again before she felt the shock.  A few minutes later her mother came to visit, and when she left, the puppy tried to as well.  She ran forward, heard the beep, kept going, and got shocked.  I'm pretty sure that I cried more than she did, but we quickly saw that it was going to work.  We continued to keep her on the leash for a while, and then after about a week, let her off to see what she would do.  We only had it on the second setting, so she was able to push her way through the field and get out of the yard.  However, she came back into the field and ended up in the front yard, not wanting to push her luck for a second shock.  She did this again on 3, so we put it on the 4th setting, and that has worked ever since.Some of the other reviews that I've read said that this can't be used as a permanent containment device.  That is not accurate.  It said right in my instructions that you need to wipe your dogs neck at the contact point as well as the contacts daily, or it WILL cause a rash.  You should also take the collar off when your dog is safely in the house.  There's no good reason for it to be on all the time.  We have been using the product for 3 months now, and she has not escaped since we bumped the intensity up.We have made putting the collar on a fun treat for her.  She stands by the back door and waits for me to put her collar on so she can get her cookie.  Then she knows that it's time to go outside and play.  I even leave it off of her sometimes, and she still stays in the containment area.  The only time that she pushes her luck is if there is someone on the other side of the fence next door, and she wants to go visit.  Then she gets her collar put back on again for another week of outside play time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Thank you for a wonderful product!", "unixReviewTime": 1295308800, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2011"}

The flow is great and is adjustable by sliding the intake left or right to make it in line with the impeller. My only complaint is that the filter does have a very slight vibrating noise when the cover of the filter is on. Perhaps the manufacturers can change that.Filters should be simple, yet effective. This filter is all that. Makes maintenance much easier and is a filter I know I can rely on. For those who have had complaints about the filter being made of cheap plastic or poor quality, then perhaps you have purchased a defective unit or feel that they should be military grade and indestructible...

From this perspective, aquarium filtration has vastly improved from the old floss filters. Any of you old timers remember those? Floss filters with metal frame tanks, boy those were the days: not! I have learned one valuable lesson from years of fish husbandry. Never use the manufactures suggested sizes for filtration. At the very least, double it if you want a good clean tank. I run two Aquaclear 50's on my forty gallon tank. I changed to this configuration from a Marineland canister with a bio wheel. The advantages of a two filter set up should be self explanatory. I run one of them with a Hagen Fluval Surface Skimmer to keep the surface clear of scum. It is a setup that works well. This is an easy filter to run with custom media too. I buy my charcoal in bulk and use filter bags. This is cheaper then buying the individual bags.The only issue with the filter becomes apparent during a power outage. If your tank is low, it might not regain suction. No damage will occur to the filter though as they are magnetically driven. Keeping your tank topped off is the best way to avoid this issue.  I have never had an issue with this filter leaking outside the tank. It only has a slight inside leak if run wide opened. It is also easy to disassemble and clean.

Many competing brands of power filters have come and gone over the many years that this filter has been in production.  And this one continues to sell today.  This design has a lot going for it.  It is inexpensive to purchase, reliable, easy to set up, easy to clean, and the replacement media are affordable.This filter is what is known as a HOB (hangs on the back of the aquarium) power filter.  The hang-on-the-back power filter design usually cater to the casual aquarist.  That is not to say that advanced aquarists do not use them.  It is just that there are other filter designs that do a better job of mechanical, chemical, and biological filtration than the simple power filter.  The main advantage to the power filter is the ease of set up.  There are no hoses to cut, and holes do not need to be drilled into the fish tank.  A small motor-driven impeller pulls water from the tank, passes it through the filter media, and then releases the water back into the tank.  All this is done by sending the water over the top edge of the tank.I can recommend this Aquaclear to someone with a freshwater tank of less than 20 gallon capacity.  It runs reliably and quietly.  If you hear a lot of noise coming from the filter, please remove the energizer (motor) and check the impeller.  Also, make sure that the inlet tube is fully inserted on top of the impeller well.  The mechanical filter is basically a coarse sponge.  You can rinse this sponge out to remove excess debris and put it back in the filter.  Just be sure to rinse it out using dechlorinated water, or waste water from the tank itself.  Unless this sponge becomes hopelessly clogged with debris (possible if you have live plants), you will not need to replace it.  The ceramic rings that are included were designed to provide a place for beneficial bacteria to colonize and attach to.  The carbon pack will need to be replaced.  How often will depend on your tank's particular situation.A canister filter will usually provide superior mechanical and chemical filtration capabilities in comparison.  However, depending on the design, maintenance will usually consume more of your time.  Wet/Dry filtration provides superior bio filtration, but will usually be more expensive.  The Penguin (Marineland) power filter brand, with their bio-wheel, is said to be better at biological filtration than this and most other competing power filter design.  It is priced competitively with the Aquaclear.  However, with the Penguin, you will have to regularly buy their filter media.  The Aquaclear gives you more flexibility and more room in the filter box.  I have used an Emperor 400 in the past on a large cichlid tank.  The Emperor, which is similar in design to the Penguins, was made by Marineland.  Very good design, but again, you will have to purchase their filter media on a regular basis.  With the Aquaclear, you can buy your own filter bag, buy carbon in bulk, and save money over the life of the filter.Why 4 stars instead of 5?  The design allows for a lot of water by-pass.  Power filters allow for some by-pass to compensate for clogged filter pads.  The Aquaclears seem to allow more by-pass than its competitors.  Also, because of the coarse design of the mechanical filter sponge, a lot of the smaller particles pass through.  The prepackaged carbon bag fits snugly in the filter box of this filter, perhaps packing the carbon granules tighter than they need to be.  The water simply just flows around the bag and only makes contact with the carbon on the edges of the bag.  I have also found that the carbon media is not very good at removing tannins from mopani wood from the water.This is a very inexpensive filter to maintain.  I know a fellow hobbyist who does not use carbon.  He just rinses the sponge during his water changes, puts it back in, and turns the filter back on.  His only expense with this filter was the initial purchase price.  I use carbon, so there is a little bit of regular expense for me.  But there are those who choose not to use carbon.  Some cichlid keepers blame carbon as a possible cause of Hole-in-the-Head disease.  I am not an expert and clearly the issues of carbon's relationship to this disease is beyond my qualifications to discuss.  Since I no longer keep cichlids, I have continued to use carbon.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Satisfactory Performance in a classic power filter", "unixReviewTime": 1388707200, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014"}

I needed or actually just wanted to try these Aquaclears that everyone raves about on one of my larger tanks. I was a bit skeptical at first about these filters (I was a Marineland fan... still kinda am)but I am very impressed. They do an awesome job at filtration and are easy to maintain. I would describe them as simple, low maintenace, very powerful, and effective. I have not yet run into any of the problems that others have complained about. I think to break them you have to be doing something wrong. There is no reason why they should not work for you and if they do die on you or you have any problems... Hagen has GREAT cutomer service. I had a slight problem with reciving cracked covers due to shipping, but it was resolved through Hagen customer service. They also say you must do regular maintenance with your Aquaclear as the sponge will get clogged which will lead to the basket floating and causing a flood. I have remedied this by buying a Filtermax III prefilter which fits perfectly on the Aquaclear. This prefilter has cut down the maintenace on the Aquaclear dramatically. Since I've owned my Filtermax III/ Aquaclear 110 combo I have only cleaned the internal sponge once. To be honest it wasnt even dirty! Most of the detrius is stopped by the Filtermax which I clean every couple of weeks. It cleans very simply and quickly in just a bucket of tankwater. Some others also complain that it wont prime itself/restart after a power outage. I do not have this problem at all. This problem has more to do with how low you choose to keep your water level. In conclusion: If your looking for great HOB's look no further than Hagen. I recommend the Fluval C4's for smaller tanks and the Aquaclear 110 for everything else. The smaller Aquaclears would be great for smaller tanks too, but I really like the Fluval C4's.

The setup was quite simple and I followed the instructions. Everything was assembled fairly quickly and easy but for some reason my package didn't come with a level. So far I'm pleased with the power of the filtration and the overall look. For the first few hours this filter was very quite and I couldn't even tell it was running. I went to the grocery store to buy some stuff and when I came back I noticed it was making more noise then before. I searched on YouTube to see if anybody else is having the same issue and it seems people are. A lot of people say it's the propeller in the motor that causes a rattling noise. I'm not one to complain about the noise because I've had louder filters before but I expected this one to be as nice and quite as when I first installed it. I'm not going to lie though after a while or at least at night when I'm trying to go the bed seeing as my tank is in the same room I sleep in the noise gets a bit annoying. I'm seeing on YouTube that the only fix is to take off the motor and lubricate the propeller. I'm going to have to remove the motor eventually to clean it out but I just find it a bit tedious to have to grease the impeller every now and then so it doesn't make that damn noise. I've read some people say that after a while the filter will settle down and break in and stop making so much noise I really hope that's the case. If not then I might have to keep this filter for as long as I can and then look to replace it with something else. It sucks that I had to go through so much trouble to get this filter hoping that it would be the perfect product but sadly it felt short. I will make an update if things get better but if not then this will be my final word. The product looks good and is assembled with ease and runs at a decent price but it has a noise issue well at least for me. I wouldn't say steer away from this filter but just know that you might encounter the same problem. I really had high hopes for this filter so maybe its my fault for expecting it to be flawless but for now I just have to deal with it until I find a solution.**Update**I used the Vaseline trick and it seemed to make a major difference the rattling noise isn't as loud anymore. It's not to say that the noise is completely gone because it's not but I can say it's been minimized to a nice hum. I don't know how long this fix will last I'm pretty sure it's only temporary and I will probably need to lubricate the impeller shaft eventually. For those of you who are having the same issue just type \"Aquaclear 20 noise\" in the YouTube search bar and you will find a few videos showing you how to do it.

I also don't think the three part filter system is any more effective than the usual mesh and charcoal filters that are much more common. I understand the concept of keeping the biological aspects of the filter intact by staggering when you change the individual parts, but if your tank is established and you leave just a little of the charcoal behind, you can achieve the same effect without having to try to remember what you should be changing next. Ultimately, I have to give this filter five stars for its quietness and steady running ability. Although a little bit harder to clean, it seems that you can just rinse everything off and reuse it - probably for quite a while - so eventually, I'll be saving money compared to filters that require completely changing out every time you clean them.

This year, I decided on rekindling this passion. I already had a 10-gallon set up that was recently vacated by my 12-year old goldfish, so I decided to switch gears and go back to tropical fish.Other filters good. AquaClear better-------------------------------------I started off my aquarium with a Biowheel filter. It was working well, but the water conditions never seemed to be quite clear enough for me. I read the positive reviews on the AquaClear and decided to pick one up from Amazon.com. The one I chose was the AquaClear 20 for my tank.The AquaClear is very configurable as you can setup the filter cage anyway you would like to. Typically, this means the foam filter at the bottom, the carbon pack in the middle, and the ceramic bio-rocks at the top. But you can also replace the carbon with any media you want from water softeners to nitrate removers. I decided to swap out the carbon with a nitrate remover.Clear water. Happy fish-----------------------My Biowheel filter worked well and the water was clear, but my tropical fish would all go to the opposite side of the tank because the water agitation from the water return was just too strong for them. After installing the AquaClear, after two-days, the tank is amazingly crystal clear (more so than the Biowheel) and the activity in my aquarium is quite good. The fish are spread out all over the tank and they really do seem happier.No noise---------There have been reports of this filter being overly noisy but I did not find this to be the case with my AquaClear 20. As a preemptive measure, I lubricated the propeller shaft with a slight coating of Vaseline, as has been pointed out on the Internet as a cure for noisy AquaClears. I used a toothpick to coat the the shaft and bushing. Upon start up and priming the filter, there is absolutely no noise coming from the motor. The only sounds are from the waterfall return gently replacing the filtered water back into the tank.I'm a believer---------------The AquaClear filter is a good buy and may very well be the last aquarium filter you purchase unless you're moving up to a bigger tank, of course.Few products do what they claim but the AquaClear is an exception and fulfills everything it is reported to do--clear, healthy water.

It has been cited as a HOB filter that performs more like a canister filter.This filter does indeed mimic a canister filter. It contains a large sponge, carbon bag (which is somewhat costly to replace, but, as you know, can be easily modified) and media bag filled with noodles to increase biological filtration. When this filter performs, it performs well.So, why the two stars? There are two qualities about this filter that make it ultimately undesirable: 1. It is difficult to use, 2. It is unreliable.Let me first talk about its difficulty. Putting this together and inserting the media are quite easy; getting it started is another thing. It comes with a leveling device to help make sure this is level on the tank. This device repeatedly pops out of its slot, to the point that I have to search for it on the floor behind my tank stand every time I service the tank. Priming it is another problem. This is one of the trickiest HOB filters to prime. One of the main reasons I disposed of my Penguin 200 is that it was a great challenge to prime. As I mentioned, I think the Penguin was defective. The Aquaclear is even more challenging to prime, and I think it is meant to work this way. (I have another Aquaclear on a separate tank that behaves the same way.) Sometimes, I have to disassemble the entire filter before I can prime it. \"You must be doing something wrong,\" someone is thinking right now. No. I'm sorry. If I have to use a level on a HOB filter before I can properly use it, then the filter is at fault, not me.The other major problem with this filter is that it is unreliable. It is not self-priming. I often have to leave town for several days, and I like having the peace of mind that, after a power outage, my filtration will continue to operate. What good is an effective system of filtration if it fails to work?But, you say, the Aquaclear provides the best biological filtration available in a HOB filter. If you want effective biological filtration in a HOB filter that is also self-priming and reliable, you won't find one on the market. However, if you buy aTetra Whisper Power Filter 60, 60-Gallonand fill it withMarineland PA11486 Canister Filter Bio-Balls PC 160-360, 90-BioBalls, you will have biological filtration that is just as effective as that provided by the Aquaclear in a filter that is self-priming and easy to use.If that doesn't appeal to you, buy aAqueon 06117 QuietFlow 50 Power Filter, 250-GPHand shove a piece of bio-sponge in the back behind the cartridges. The Aqueon filters are totally self-priming and never fail to work after a power outage because of their clever design.With just a simple mod, you can have a filter that is even better than the Aquaclear without the hassle.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not the Best.", "unixReviewTime": 1345161600, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2012"}

The problem with them is that they will release the ammonia they have absorbed if salt is added to the water. This is very bad as the first step after doing a water change when an ammonia spike occurs is to add salt to the water along with something like seachem prime, If you do not remove the zeolite before doing this then the problem will be compounded.I also do not use carbon on a regular bases.

They are fairly compact, well-made, affordable, and easy to set up, use, and clean.The media baskets in AC filters are quite large compared to many other filters, so you can cram quite a lot in there if you want to. The media is stacked in the tray vertically, so the coarse sponge should be on the bottom, with the biological media and fine filtration on top of that. I also use a cut up sponge on the intake as a prefilter to protect the impeller from any sand that might get kicked up from the bottom. The sponges are inexpensive and can be reused for quite a long time if you clean them regularly.The flow rate of the water can be adjusted by rotating the intake tubing away from the impeller, which is good when you are feeding and want the food to stay at the surface. I usually allow the filter to run at maximum flow most of the time and use a baffle I made from an old soft drink bottle to keep from agitating the water too much. I would recommend getting one filter size up from the tank you plan on using it for though. I use the AC50 on a 20g tank, and I feel that it is an appropriate amount of filtration.

I have five Aquaclear 20's - three on guppy tanks, and two kept as spares in the event of a breakdown. However, in over a year of constant service, I have yet to have an Aquaclear HOB filter's electric motor burn out.Moreover, one must take care to turn these filters off when you are using a sand substrate which is being stirred up in the tank, since the sand can get into the motor and cause it to run roughly, or seize up.Even if this happens, all it usually takes to get these motors running again is to remove them from the filter housing, remove the impeller from the housing on the motor and clean the unit with water and a q-tip.Once you have done so, the motor will usually begin to run properly again.I also own an Aquaclear 50 which I now keep on my 10 gallon tank, and an Aquaclear 110 which I use to filter a heavily planted 20 long tank with about 16 fish.So the extra filtering ability of the Aquaclear 110 is nice to have.As for the Aquaclear 70, this will be replacing the Aquaclear 50 which I used to filter my 37 gallon tank, and have now moved to my 10 gallon.The Aquaclear 70 will be used in conjunction with a Fluval 305 canister filter for redundant filtration.The Fluval 305, like the Aquaclear, is another Hagen product.  It seems like virtually every product that is sold for the aquarist is manufactured by a subsidiary of Hagen's.The 305 is also a very cleverly designed filter,  which works quite well, and is very easy to maintain, thanks to Fluval's patented Aquastop feature; the Aquastop fitting allows you to disconnect the 305 from its tubing without losing  suction, so that you don't have to reprime the unit once you've dumped the water from its container during a filter change.All you do is reconnect the Aquastop fitting to the top of the 305's canister, and then  open the flow valve until the 305 fills with water.You must open the valve partially to avoid creating a tremendous amount of turbulance in your aquarium, since if you open it all the way while filling the 305, the air bubbles will race out of the 305's exhaust tube disturbing your fish.As for the controvery between which canister is best, many people who consider the purchase of a Fluval also consider buying an Eheim, and there are those who own both.  The Eheim - Fluval debate reminds this author of the Chevy-Ford controversy, regarding the merits of each.Moreover, I have owned both and  find that Fluval and Eheim both make excellent canister filters.  However, the Fluval's internal setup is much easier to use, given the trays Fluval includes to add filter media to, while the Eheim Classic series (I'm not certain if the other Eheim filters are the same way) just stack the media atop one another, making for a more complex arrangement, since the Eheim's filter media is in not in a tray.Both filters are well made and reliable.  However,  one must take care to re-lubricate the Fluval's o-ring after each cleaning to ensure that it does not dry out, since this will prevent the unit from leaking onto your floor. And careful removal of the impeller housing will ensure that the impeller that does not get damaged.After more than a year with the Aquaclear series of filters, as well as the several months with a Fluval 305, I must say that I am very pleased with these units.

Those that do such as Penguin, for example, are nice filters but for the money they are not worth it compared the aquaclear. Also, penguins parts (like the overly marketed BIOWheel) are hard to find, expensive, and not all that convienent to replace. Aquaclear is quick, easy, QUIET, and gets the job done!

Fairly easy to install.  A couple minor issues:When on high (variable speeds, remember), a small amount of water drains back out into the tank on the intake side of the filter.  Not a huge deal, but frustrating.  An overflow hole in the media cage should drain the water out onto the correct (outflow) side of the filter, but it doesn't.  I have it set to a slightly lower setting, which fixes the issue.The cheap plastic cover vibrates and increases sound.  Not a whole lot, and I should be able to minimize that by putting a few pieces of rubber seal under it.  But then, Aquaclear could/should have done the same.My tank has a slightly wider-than-normal rim, so the filter doesn't quite fit perfectly as it hangs over; it is probably 1/2 inch higher off the rim than designed (though still level), which increases waterfall distance, and therefore noise.  I could try jamming it down further, but I would imagine its plastic case would crack.Overall, after 3 days, it works fairly well, and isn't terribly noisy, and thanks to the media cage design, I can be creative with the media make-up (carbon is generally unnecessary and can be replaced with anything you'd like).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Works well, but vibrates.", "unixReviewTime": 1286323200, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2010"}

My fish have suffered from it.The maintenance directions say to clean the impeller every 2 months, and this I have been doing on both units. I contacted the maker, Hagen, and they asked me to put veg oil around the magnet part of the impeller. I tried this as well, but it was loud and I didn't trust it anymore. Within a couple weeks, it had stopped working again.Hagen said I had to send the motor unit back to them with tracking and insurance recommended, at my own expense, and now I'm waiting for some sort of response. Meanwhile, my goldies are depending on a filter that is too small for their tank and an airstone while I wait... if I don't get some response soon, I will be downgrading my review to reflect this.I wish All-Glass Aquarium company made filters.

It has an adjustable flow rate, which is a really important feature to me. Instead of using overpriced filterpads, it has a large media basket so you can put WHATEVER filter medium you want in this filter, which is also really special to me, because I'm kinda on a low budget (price for filter pads REALLY adds up), and I don't use carbon in my tanks (pretty much all premade cartridges use carbon). As described, this filter comes with activated carbon (which I put off to the side, as I said earlier I don't use carbon in my tanks), biomax, and a sponge.It also comes with a really nifty device for leveling the filter on the back of the tank. Since it is clear you can see when the mechanical filtration media is starting to get clogged up. The only two things I have agiasnt this filter is that its made with fairly flimsy plastic, and the GPH ratings are WAY too low for the tank size they're intended for. I got the 50 for my 29 knowing that almost all filters were too small for the tank size they were intended for, but I didn't \"oversize\" enough, because the 50 is still too small for my 29 gallon at only 200 GPH (let alone the 50 gallon it's intended for), a filter of this type should have a GPH AT LEAST 8 times the size of the tank it is intended for. Now lets do the math. 8 times 50 (the tank size it is intended for) is 400, so this filter is off by 200 GPH for its intended tank size, and 8 time 29 is 232, so it is off by 32 GPH for my tank. That means an aqeon 30 is more suited for my tank then the AC50. I am now getting the AC70 which is 300 GPH. In conclusion, It is a very good filter, just make sure you don't get fooled by the \"up to (your tank size here) gallon tanks\" rating and get one that is 8 to 10 times more GPH then your tank (For example you would need the AC30 (150 GPH) for a 15 gallon tank.

As someone who has a dedicate fish room with dozens of tanks, I very much appreciate the silence.  Unfortunately, I have replaced all of my AC filters with Whispers or Eheim canister filters.  Below are my reasons.1. While the filter media design with the basket is brilliant, it gets messy when removing the basket from the filter.  As you lift the basket, water may drip around the filter if you don't do this very slowly.  Not a deal breaker since the basket design enables you to be creative with the filter media.2. The water intake pipe snugly fits into the filter housing.  While secure, this prevents me from simply lifting the intake out of the assembly like the Whispers do for weekly maintenance. Again, not a show stopper.3. If the filter media gets full, the water can backup and overflow behind the filter housing.  Having the top cover on will help minimize the damage, but will indeed overflow.  The lever at the bottom of the housing must be used to angle the filter such that any overflow can be prevented and be forced to be dumped forward back into the tank.  Maybe a deal breaker.4. Deal breaker for me was that the plastic housing developed a hairline crack that leaked water very slowly.  Not a problem for the tank or fish, but definitely damaged hardwood floor since the problem was caught too late due to such slow drip.5. Lastly, the impeller gets stuck after a power outage.  Sure, more frequent cleaning could help but I never have this problem with any of the Whisper filters.Above problems are not just for AC50, but applies to all AC HOB series.  I had the AC20, AC30, and AC50 for two years and ended of replacing all of them.Excellent product when it's working, but I'll stick with the Whisper HOB even though they are a little noisier.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "maintenance can be messy", "unixReviewTime": 1326153600, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2012"}

This filter replaced an Aqua Tech 30-60 model which would not keep my water clear unless I replaced the cartridges every week (as you can imagine, that was getting ridiculously expensive). My fish kept looking sick and I eventually decided it was the filter not working right (I had an Aqua Tech 20-40 before and that one didn't work either; thought bigger filter is better but apparently not with that brand). Anyway, I installed this filter in the evening and at the time my fish were REALLY sick looking and I was of course checking on it often hoping it would work. The next morning the water was still cloudy and my fish weren't behaving much different, so I did a 10% water change (changing too much water + new filter = trouble). Ten percent really isn't much, so the water was still cloudy. I did notice that 24 hours after installing the filter, my fish began to look slightly better and a bit more active. Within 36 hours this filter made my tank water crystal clear! (See my product images for before & after shots.)I just purchased a 2nd Aqua Clear 50 because I do have a few messy fish in my tank and this filter only moves 200 gallons per hour - for a 29 gallon tank it should be moving about 230 gallons minimum. I didn't buy a larger model because I have only about 2.5\" between the back of my tank and the wall.If you have that issue, here are the approximate measurements of the unit and how much space you need between tank and wall:AquaClear 20: 5\"L X 4\"W X 6\"H with 2 1/2\" of the width behind the tankAquaClear 50: 7\"L X 4\"W X 6 1/2\"H with 2 1/2\" of its width behind the tankAquaClear 70: 8 1/2\"L X 6\"W X 8\"H with 3 3/4\" of its width behind the tankAquaClear 110: 13 1/2\"L X 6 3/4\"W X 9\"H with 4\" of its width behind the tankWill try to update about longevity once I've had it a while. So far, minimal noise, easy to install, no problems! Fish are very active, they like it!Update (6/12): The first filter I got leaked by the cord. It did cause some water damage to my stand (wood). Thankfully my 29-gallon background was folded at the bottom and it caught most of the water in the fold. I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement with 1-day shipping. My 2nd 50 filter worked while the first was being replaced so I was glad I had 2 to start out. Despite the leak, I still purchased more of these filters for another tank I set up and am not changing my 5-star rating. I really feel these are the best out there! One suggestion, though, be sure to place something behind your tank, under the filter in case it leaks, and check it regularly. I'm going to use a Rubbermaid container (with the lid off).

Ie, so you have a filter for a 50 gallon tank on a 25 gallon tank, a filter for a 100 gallon tank on a 50 gallon tank, etc. It makes for healthier fish and less maintenance.I have a prefilter (Pre-Filter Sponge 3 Pack for Fluval Edge Aquarium) on the AquaClear 30 to keep the cherry shrimp and fry from getting sucked up into the filter. The prefilter fits on the uptake tube perfectly and is working as it should.I recently ran an Aquaclear 70 and an AquaClear 110 on a 55 gallon tank. Both of those filters were much louder than this little AquaClear 30. I'm guessing that the more powerful the motor is, the louder the filter is. I did try the trick of swabbing silicon grease on the impeller shaft, and both of those two larger filters were still too loud for me. I am now running a canister filter on that tank, and am very happy with it.I've also tried the \"updated\" version of the AquaClear line, theFluval C4 Power Filter. I did not like that filter as much as the old AquaClears. The Fluval was not any quieter, and there was so much hardware in the filter box that it really forced you to use only their filter media. One of the great things about the Aquaclears is that you can put in just about anything you want in the filter box, like peat moss, or ammorocks, or whatever your heart desires. I like that flexibility.As much as I like the Aquaclears, though, I leave them behind for canister filters when the tank is any more than 50 gallons. Hang on back filters are OK, but for a big tank or for any tank that needs top-notch water quality, give me a canister filter.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very quiet and fairly effective filter at a good price", "unixReviewTime": 1345161600, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2012"}

I put the AquaClear filter in and after a day, my water was crystal clear.  After 4 or so days, I tested my parameters again.  Ammonia and Nitrites were at 0 and my nitrates had come up to 5ppm.

However, many people suffer from their noise (one told that he/she woke up at night due to the noise).Would there be a perfect cure for this? Some suggest that you apply Vaseline on the metal shaft for the impeller (Vaseline or white petroleum jelly is aquarium safe). I had the noise problem for my AC20, and tried Vaseline. It helps a bit but does not remove the noise entirely. I believe if you are running AC20 in an environment with a moderate noise such as in an office or living room, you wouldn't have much trouble with this Vaseline cure (maybe you don't have to do any thing at all). But if you are quite sensitive to noise, I would hesitate to install in the bedroom. I have an Eheim Classic Canister Filter 150 next to AquaClear 20. I cannot tell if Eheim canister filter makes any noise unless I put my ear to the canister head. But I can hear the noise from AquaClear 20 from 9 feet away (after the Vaseline cure).Another way to reduce noise is to take the lid off. The lid certainly amplifies the vibrating noise unless it is tightly secured to the filter casing. Some put heavy things on the lid to tighten the gap between the lid and the filter case. However, this might cause the gap adjusting wheel between the filter and the aquarium glass wall to fall off because the wheel is simply put in a hole at the bottle of the case. Some suggest put Vaseline around on the case edge so that the gap between the case and the lid is filled. I have not tried this solution for myself, but I wouldn't do this because it could be messy. I rather took off the lid.AC filters are very functional. It has three-stage filtrate system. You might wonder if you have to move to Fluval C series. But, for smaller tanks under 10 gallons, AC 20 should provide enough filtration.One thing I live about AC 20 is that I can control the flow. I will be useful if you keep plants in your tank. Often you don't want to cause too strong current for your plants.If there were real silent power filters, it would be perfect for small tanks (under 10G). Canister filters are nice, but you have to provide separate space and work with their hoses. If you have a 5G nano tank, you would hesitate to have a canister filter that will take more or less the same space as your tank does. A simple hanging power filter like AC20 would be good choice - I like the inconspicuous transparent dark plastic color. Fluval C2's red color stands out too much.I also recommend to use Fluval prefilter sponge that fits AC's intake tube for more biological and mechanical filtration.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Probably needs some cure", "unixReviewTime": 1362960000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2013"}

This filter was truly designed by someone who understood marine filtaration.  I say that because people don't realize in addition to the carbon needed, the reason your tank \"cycles\" is becuase it needs a chance to build up natural denitrifying bacteria.  That bacteria needs a place to implanat and although it microscopiclly implants itself on the tank walls and on live rock, the main place it implants is on the cloth or pad in the filter.  The problem with this is whenever you throw out the carbon and it's packaged  with the pad all in one, you're throwing out your main source of this bacteria!!  The benefit of this filter is that is has seperaste media so that when you throw out the carbon, you still have your sponge pad right under it which has built up a lot of the bacteria, in addition to the white  filter media above it whose only purpose is to house these bacteria.  So as long as you change these three \"filter media\" in intervals and not all at once, you will have a source of the bacteria and it will regrow on to the one you just changed.  This is crucial and is the purpose of \"bio balls\" in the wet dry filter system.  That's why you rarely change them.  They house the bacteria.  In addition, this filter has a great flow rate and for me DOES NOT need priming if the power goes out.  If it does for you, it's becuause the intake that goes into you tank which sucks the water into the filter is not connecteed tightly to the upper part of that same tube, thus having an air leak, which is what breaks the siphon when your power goes out.  Try retightening that connection and test it by unplugging the filter from the wall and plug it back in, it should start right back up.

I'm no Cesar Millan, but I've tried exercise, training, games...everything I know of, and he still barks when triggered by animals and sounds. I used a spray collar on him for a year. Dogs have a very strong sense of smell, so every time he smelled the collar he knew exactly what was going on. He would cower and become a sad, pathetic little dog. As soon as I took it off, he would go nuts. He knew when it was on and off and totally played the system (and his owners) on that one. It was clear that he needed something a bit more \"encouraging.\"As soon as I got this collar, I read the manual thoroughly. Twice. I placed it around his neck and waited.

He clearly got the message.There are two things I don't like about this product:1. The battery. It's a basic watch battery set (very firmly) in a plastic casing. PetSafe should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a rip off battery.2. There's no manual setting. I would love to have it on auto when I leave the house and on manual when at home, only to snap him out of bad behavior. My dream product would be the field training collar and the bark collar fused into one, giving me (the dog owner) total control of my dog rather the bark collar (the machine) having control over him.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Solid product", "unixReviewTime": 1310083200, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2011"}

{"reviewerID": "A3KZS50RI0JU30", "asin": "B00023D368", "reviewerName": "Nick Savage", "helpful": [562, 572], "reviewText": "A Few thing I don't like about this product:-The collar loosens and has come off by itself.  It may seem like an innovative collar design to have both a buckle and a clasp, but it's not.  It's a very cheap collar.  As another reviewer stated, it's worth buying a quality collar to replace the el-cheapo one that comes with the device. (Hey, I bought one from the grocery store for 4 dollars that is higher quality).  Also, because it's very important to have a dog bark collar that is snug, but not overly tight or too loose, a buckle is terrible idea.  The holes in the collar are at about 1 inch increments so your most likely not going to get the best fit.  Buy a collar that allows for a custom fit.-Other reviewer's mention that the collar repeatedly shocks their dog for no reason at all.  I've also experienced this and it was due to user error.  I had my mini-aussie sitting in the truck next to me and I was talking in her ear telling her she's a good girl and I saw her head bob as it does when she is getting a static correction.  I looked at the collar and the setting was set to 'test'. She was getting shocked each time I talked to her.  Setting it to off or a regular setting fixed the problem.  Kind of a design mistake if you ask me.  I don't like the thought that I could accidentally leave the device on test while I'm in a hurry to get out the door and my dog gets shocked the rest of the day.  It's the lowest setting shock, but just moving or slight sounds set it off.  MAKE SURE YOU DON'T LEAVE IT ON TEST MODE.-The RFA-97 proprietary batteries.  While they are not going to break the bank at 4 for ~13 dollars plus shipping, it does add up. (My first battery was depleted in aprox. 6 weeks of continuous usage).  Another reviewer briefly mentions that she was able to pry the battery out and replaced it.  I have not done this and instead was able to find a company on ebay that mentioned their website rfa97 (I don't want to directly link, but you can search for RFA67 Battery Holder).  disclaimer: I have not yet used this product, so I can't comment on it.  But I can say that it will save me money because it uses the ubiquitous cr-2032 watch batteries.  Shame on pet safe for profiteering on a battery revenue.What I like about the collar:-Seems to work better than my other cheaper pet safe model.  I was using a cheaper brand for a while but lost it around the house. (fell into the couch cushions!) I still needed a bark collar, so I spent a long time reading reviews before I settled on the pdc-300.  I have to say that it has been a night and day change with my dog.  She used to herd other dogs and not care about the static correction on the cheaper model, but this model has 3 levels of adaptive correction and when it's on 2 of 3, one bark is enough and she quiets down.  The collar works from the start and keeps her calm to avoid escalation of her barking.  I was about to get kicked out of the place I\"m living because of her, and just today my landlord said she has seen a huge improvement.**KEEP IN MIND - static correction is not a substitute for exercising your dog.  Your dog may be barking because he/she is bored.  Exercise your dog for at least 45mins-2 hours a day (depending on breed) and keep it up.  In a few weeks you will see the difference  Exercise is fun for you and your dog.  Yes, you do have the time.  Just because it gets dark outside when you come home is no excuse.  Train your dog to run on a treadmill or buy an LED meteorlite ball that lights up the night (also sold on amazon) and play fetch with your dog in the dark.I gave the product a 3 out of 5 stars due to what I view as shortcomings of the product.  However, it's better than most of the collars on the market, so I would still recommend it.Finally, if you learned something from my review, please click it as being helpful.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Shortcomings such as battery, test mode and cheap collar", "unixReviewTime": 1231718400, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2009"}

My long-haired collie still barks but it's certainly better with the collar than without.  It also seems to work better when she has a summer hair cut as the metal probes can reach her skin more easily.The other drawback of this collar is that the on/off/setting button is ANNOYING. Older models had a dial you could turn. On this model, you push and hold a little button for 2-3 seconds, let go, and the setting changes. For example, to change from correction level 1 to 2, you have to press and hold the button for 2-3 sec, then let go.  If you want correction level 3, you have to do it again. After correction level 3, pressing the button and releasing takes you to Test mode. Then you can press it again to turn it off.  Cycling through all of these settings is slow and frustrating, especially since you might release the button too soon (setting doesn't change) or you might hold it in too long.TIP:I have discovered a trick that I'm not sure is explained in the instructions.  You can avoid cycling through all of these levels if e.g., your dog always needs correction level 3. When you're ready to turn the collar off, press and keep holding the button until you see if flash green, and then red (do NOT let go after it flashes green). When it flashes red, the unit is off. To turn it back on, press the button twice, and it will automatically take you back to the level you used last. [If I hadn't discovered this 'feature' of the collar, I think I would have given up on it a long time ago.]OVERALL:I would still buy this collar. I trust the brand in terms of my pet's safety.

I would much prefer a single on/off switch with a separate means to adjust the mode. 10 to 20 seconds to turn the collar off is a long time for a young dog to hold still enough to turn off the collar. It is possible to miss the light signals and actually increase the setting instead of turning it off.I do like the fact that the levels are adjustable and within a level the corrections are automatically progressive - giving the dog a mild shock to start. The vibration and sound sensors are reassuring to me in preventing -false- shocks.There is no question that my dog understood exactly what was triggering the shock and her learning was quick. One to three corrections seemed to be all it took to achieve the desired result.

{"reviewerID": "A1MUDEF8PF42H5", "asin": "B00023D368", "reviewerName": "Tracy", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "I've had this bark collar for over a year so I can give you a true review. The honeymoon period is over, so here's the skinny.It works. It doesn't shock the dog unnecessarily, and I like that if the dog keeps barking (like, &#34;OMG there's a strange man in the yard, I'm freaking out and barking even though I've been shocked over and over!&#34; it DOES stop shocking them when they exceed a certain number of barks, but it isn't so few that they learn how to tough it out and continue to bark. It's a good mix of enough and not too much.It's waterproof. We have a pool, and our dog swims while we are gone. It is truly waterproof.The cons- the sliding buckle has nothing to prevent the clasp from sliding right off the end. Others mentioned this but I didn't listen. One day the collar was on the ground, the dog was collarless, and the black, plastic buckle (the 3 fingered prong part) was gone. I never found it. This is what  I did to fix it, but listen to me and fix it before you lose it: I had to cut the collar off the nylon part and attach it to a new collar. I may be female but I don't sew. Superglue is my friend. I glued it to a leather collar. It's held this way for months, even getting wet in the pool.However! If you take the end of the collar that has no &#34;stop&#34; built in and fold it a bit, superglue it together, it will make it where the buckle can't just slide off. You could sew it if you'd prefer, but superglue adheres great on the nylon.Another con- the on/off switch is finicky. You have to hold it down to turn the collar off, but you have to watch it and make sure it blinks a certain number of times, indicating it's really turning off. When you turn it on, you have to make sure it blinks the right amount of green blinks (one= light shock, 2= medium shocks, 3=the &#34;meanest&#34; shocks). There is a time delay in the blinking. If  you have a dog that goes in and out a million times a day like mine, you will be putting it on and taking it off all day long. (NOTE, the dog shouldn't wear the collar while inside, it can cause skin irritation because it's so tight by necessity and it jabs into their trachea while eating, so please don't just leave it on your dog while he or she comes in, that's not nice!) I got fed up when I noticed that I had inadvertently changed it to test mode (blinks orange) or changed the shock setting, and I got tired of standing there, peering at the tiny little cell phone led sized lights waiting for the blinks, so we just leave it on 24/7. It's really much easier. The battery lasted at least 3 months even with it on all the time. Just order a 2 pack of extra batteries and keep them around. They're about $6 if I remember correctly. In a year's time we haven't used the one it came with and the spare- well worth the time saved by not having to decipher the blinking lights.Also, after this amount of time the white writing on the unit itself is wearing off. If I didn't know how to use it, I might not be able to figure it out because the writing is nearly gone.Some how to tips- make sure it's tight on the dog's neck. It works by vibration and this ensures that your dog doesn't get shocked from another dog's barking. Make it tight but obviously don't choke the dog. I keep it above, higher on the neck, more towards the chin on my dog, above his regular collar. He doesn't dislike wearing it. He stands still and happily lets me put it on him every day.A last word of advice- I rescue dogs and work in a animal rescue. Please have current name/phone # tags on your dog at all times, and spay and neuter your dog! Don't let your outdoor cat who has no collar and is not neutered or spayed roam free, or you may find your cat eaer tipped and altered by someone like me who traps them and takes them into be altered.

We set it for 1/2 an hour before we get up in the morning, so she not waking us up asking for food; and 2 more times while I'm at work.  Because she knows it will feed her at the same time everyday, she rarely begs us for food in the mornings and afternoons anymore.

Its also great for when we go away over night or when were out late in the evening because I don't have to worry about her starving the whole time.

We use chilled canned food in ours, along with a couple of ice cubes.  The ice cubes help control the food temperature, and add moisture to the food as they melt.  Each food container can easily hold a 3.3 oz can of food and ice cubes.+ Our two cats took to the feeder right away.  One sits staring at the closed containers for long periods of time, apparently willing them to open for her.  She has not made a serious attempt to open them yet, but the feeder can  withstand the occassional prying paw.+ As an added bonus, using this unit for early morning feedings has quickly conditioned the cats to stop their annoying bedside \"wake up calls\".  They go pester the feeder instead of trying to wake us up. That alone is worth the price!+ Works fine with a rechargeable AA battery, and one battery lasts a long time.Cons:- For us, precise timing is very important.  The unit's timer seems to do very well if you are setting it for whole-hour increments of four hours or more; anything less is pretty \"iffy\".  When I thought I was setting two units to open at the same time (test run), they actually opened about 20 minutes apart.  Not a big deal, unless you have two hungry cats and one open food bowl.- The units seem pretty flimsy, especially the mechanisms that latch and lift the lids.  I don't know that they will last very long.- I really wish the unit would make some sort of noise to alert cats when it opens.  As is, it opens almost silently (much quieter than the can opener that brings them running!), so food sits open until they wander in and notice it.  This is especially a concern with a potentially hypoglycemic cat, but I can't imagine that it is ever ideal.- I wish the food trays weren't plastic, as this is not the healthiest option for pets.  Among other things, it can cause \"kitty acne\" - that black crusty stuff on cat's chin.- The unit is not made to work with an AC adaptor, and there is no low battery warning light or signal.  Thus, it is a worry that the battery will run down and the feeder won't open while we are away.All in all, it is a good very basic unit to help manage feeding cats and small dogs for short trips, between catsitter visits on longer trips, and for daytime or nightime snacks for cats with special dietary needs.I just wonder why there does not seem to be a top-of-the-line timed pet feeder out there.  A sturdy model with stainless steel food cups, a digital timer, built-in storage for cold packs, and an optional feeding chime would be worth spending money on!

Downey \"OneKindredSpirit\"", "helpful": [12, 13], "reviewText": "My cats always wake me up around 4 or 5 am to feed them, no matter how late I give them their last meal of the day.  Hoping to avoid having to get up at this hour, I bought two of these units (they each eat different food and in a different location.)  Setup was easy enough.  I was able to coordinate the two so they activate within roughly 10 seconds of each other.Day one was pure comedy.  The cats were nearby their dishes when the motors kicked on (it's kinda loud).  They freaked:  Fluffed up like they'd stuck their little paws in an electrical outlet, ran, stopped, crouched, and hissed.  Once I'd regained my composure, I coaxed each one into coming to look and eventually eat from the bowl.Day two through four, the cats still shy away when the motor turns on, but are no longer freaked out.  They still don't 'get it' ... that the sound means food is now available to eat.  In order to get them to associate the sound with something good (food), I made an effort to be nearby at mealtimes so when the dishes kicked on, I could say, \"Hungry, hungry, hungry?\" and then wiggle my fingers in the bowl to show the food was in there.  \"Hungry\" is what I would say when feeding them before, so they already knew what those words meant.  I just needed them to make the connection to the sound.Day five.  The lightbulb goes on at the last meal of the day.  (I feed them a little less than 1/4 cup food every 6 hours.)  They got me up at 5:25 am for their first meal of the day, still not realizing food was already sitting in the dishes for them.  So, for the next two meals, when the motor kicked on, in addition to repeating the word \"hungry\", I picked them up and took them immediately to their feeders.Tonight was perfect. The feeders clicked on and both cats ran to their dishes right way and began eating.  Hurray!  I hope this will also be the case in the wee hours of the morning starting tomorrow.  I'm very much looking forward to no longer having to endure their early AM pestering for food.Update after three months:  I'm in Heaven!  I get to sleep through the night.  The cats love their feeders and so do I.  My main motivation for getting these was the interrupted sleep, however, it's been really wonderful all the way around.  I have only to remember to fill the feeders each evening, and I'm set for 24 hrs ... free to come and go without the worry of hungry cats awaiting my arrival for their next meal.July 2013:  Wow!  Four years later and I'm still loving these feeders.  I think in all this time I've changed the batteries only a couple times.  One of the units is still working absolutely perfectly and the other recently started to have difficulty rotating the bowl.  It's beginning to stick and in the last couple days, it's happening a lot.  Sometimes after a bit of strain it moves but other times it totally sticks and continues to run until I push the bowl.  The mechanism that makes it spin seems to be a bit stripped.  I've tried rotating the bowl to different positions on the spinner and cleaning it well, but have been unable to resolve the dysfunction.  So, rather than waiting until it completely conks out, I decided to purchase another unit.  I got four years of near-flawless functioning from this unit, so no complaints, especially since the other one is going strong.  I'm looking forward to at least another four years of excellent performance from the new unit.Periodically (every couple of months) I have to resynchronize the bowls.  They are running about 1 minute apart by then and I like both cats to start eating at roughly the same time so they are not both trying to eat from the feeder that activates first.

Karazim", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Like many others, I purchased this feeder to quell the feeding antics of an over-enthusiastic eater, my fat orange tabby cat.  I came seeking relief from an otherwise cuddly beast who couldn't seem to let my husband and I complete a full night's rest without some kind of wake up call, most recently beginning at 5 am and continuing indefinitely until one of us got up to feed the poor, starving darling.  We had tossed around the idea of an automatic feeder for several months, and as our friend's morning habits continued to get worse and worse, I knew it was time.I liked the design of the Petsafe, and I liked the 5-Meal option as well.  Figuring that this purchase could double as a babysitter for short weekend trips, we pulled the trigger and bought it at a local store (at a premium, but we needed it quick).  I hoped that she would not figure out how to manually rotate the bowl herself, since there are many reports of that happening with this and other auto feeders.  All the auto-feeders have those reviews, and I'm sure none of them is completely cat-proof,  but this one had a lot of positives as well.  Seems that my tabby is fat and greedy, but not particularly intelligent, or at least not savvy enough to break into this feeder (yet).  We're on our third day with no break-ins.I also wondered if she'd be afraid of the noise the dish makes when it rotates, and would therefore avoid it.  It's not loud, but she can be very neurotic about noises.  I fed her with it for the first time without setting the timer.  She was not thrilled with the strange new bowl, but she realized that she'd have to comply if she was to eat.  Then, later on that night I put treats in a few of the compartments and had it rotate every 10 minutes for the next half hour.  Once she was comfortable with the sound of the rotating, I set the timer for the next day's feedings and put the dish beside our bedroom door, right where she begs in the morning.The next morning I heard nothing.  Not one peep.  I woke up to an empty bowl and a happy cat.  Every feeding after that one has been wonderful.  I returned home from work that evening to find a relaxed, content animal instead of a desperately hungry one.I really wish that this thing had an a/c adapter of some kind, even if it was an optional accessory.  D batteries are expensive and I'm probably going to buy some rechargeables to help keep the cost of operation down.  Also, it's not exactly a 5-Meal feeder, at least not really.  One of the sections will always be exposed, so you can't really set it for five meals without feeding the first meal immediately.  For those two reasons I deducted a star.  Otherwise this is wonderful for those who value sleep and have a persistent cat!*Update 6-15-10*The batteries have not been replaced and are still going strong.  My cat has not figured out how to rotate the bowl herself.  She never meows in the morning unless I forget to fill the feeder.

We tried the electronic feeder that spills food down into the bowl, but that would often send down two feedings at once, not good for our cat who we are trying to keep on a diet. We like that we can program this device to portion control feedings several times EACH day instead of every 6 or 12 hours etc.. We can safely and assuredly portion control our cat's food every day according to his activity schedule. We change it as the seasons change and his activity changes. He knows when it turns and he is happy. It is very well built, and our 18 lb cat can't turn it even when he throws a tantrum between meal times. I just now bought a back up unit because we are so dependent on this for our cat's happiness and our peace of mind. For this price, if it lasts for another six months who can complain? It might last for years more. I wanted to give a fair review from someone who has used this product and has relied on this product for 18 solid months--even when we have gone away for the weekend leaving the cat home unattended. No more worries. The batteries last forever, but I still replace them every six months because feeding our cat is a top priority, of course. This Petsafe electronic automatic feeder has never skipped a meal.I hope this helps a little with your decision.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Time tested, accurate and well built", "unixReviewTime": 1301184000, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2011"}

Our cat gained tons of weight while being free-fed.  Now we can control when she eats, have it supply a meal at 7:00 a.m. so she's not howling at us to feed her in the morning, and then we have the second feeder open at noon.  We feed her wet food, by hand, at night.  The problem I had with the other types of gravity units is that 1/4 cup is the minimum allowable.  We need to feed her less than 1/4 cup in each of the two daily dry feedings, and this unit allows you to put as little or as much kibble as needed.  I have not had any of the problems the other reviewers stated (cat being able to push the tray for another feeding, tray not turning, etc.)  The only complaint I have is that the instructions are not that clear and there are no additional trays to purchase while one is in the dishwasher.  I bought the second unit so that I just have to fill the trays every four days instead of every two.  To clarify the instructions, just plug in the time of day when the feeder is to open.  I thought originally that you had to program it for each of the five \"trays\" to open.  So, one unit has one time plugged in for 7:00 am instead of five 7:00 am's and the other has noon plugged in once.  Tray rotates whatever time(s) you set - not just 12 and 24-hour periods.

I can't vouch for its claim to cure ich in two days in all cases, but it is a rather fast-working product.I like that this product is not as harsh a treatment as the wide-spectrum antibiotic preparations that people too often use for fish diseases. While it seems natural to reach for strong microbials when your fish are sick, it can stress out your fish even more, making things worse. QuICK Cure cures ich without resorting to antibiotics.As with all ich treatment regimes, this works better if you raise the aquarium temperatures and keep the hood lights off. That will help speed along the ich parasite's life cycle and keep your fish in a quiet healing state.Other caveats - you have to remove the carbon from your aquarium filters before adding the treatment drops, or it won't work at all.You will need to use the smaller recommended dose with tetras. Thin-skinned fishes, like the catfishes, botias and loaches must actually be removed, since the malachite green in the medication is too readily absorbed and becomes toxic to them.QuICK Cure comes in a small dropper squeezy container. A 4 oz bottle treats thousands of gallons, which is a lot of ich. In other words, this one product should last your lifetime! Remember not to over-treat; use only the amount recommended per gallon. This product will turn your water blue and will dye anything else it touches. Be careful not to let this stuff touch you too much, since formalin is a cancer-causing agent.If you have a big ich infestation, I recommend using this medication.

Yeah, I know....Petland Discounts...But he was the littlest guy in the tank and he was being picked on and his tail was already ripped from being harassed.  So into the bag he went.  Five days later, he was not just showing ich...he was COVERED in it.  Head to tail. He broke out overnight. And a couple of my other fish were showing spots.  The ich had taken over my entire tank and Mr. Flowerhorn was the culprit.  I don't have another tank to act as a QT (quarantine tank), so please don't be so hard on me for not quarantining. I have kept fish for a long time and usually have an assortment of products to get me through situations like this...and I DID.  I had a bottle of Rid Ich+!  OH JOY!!  So I started treating the tank....yeah...right.  By day three the poor Flowerhorn was on his side on the top of the tank, fins clamped, barely moving. Good thing I had called a fish expert friend of mine who told me to use the Rid Ich+ just until I could get some Quick Cure.  None of my local stores had it in stock so I turned to Amazon as usual and it showed up just in time.  UPS delivered at 3:45, by 4:15 I had done a partial water change and medicated the tank.  I did not have high hopes about the poor Flowerhorn because he was not looking like he was going to make it. However, no more than 5 hours later I went past the tank and OMG!!!!  The Flowerhorn was swimming around the tank and he actually looked like he had less ich on him.  5 hours! Of course he was still clamped and still had a good deal of ich on him...but in 5 hours he went from having one fin in the toilet to looking like there was hope after all. I HAD to come write this review because I really could not believe the difference that this med made in 5 hours, whereas he was getting worse during the three days of treatment with Rid Ich+. I should also tell you that I had to use very very little Quick Cure. One drop per gallon, which is a fraction of the dosage of Rid Ich+ for my 55 gallon tank. Also, where Rid Ich+ demands a partial water change before EACH dosage, the Quick Cure's directions say to do a water change after three days of treatment, especially if treatment needs to be continued after the third day. As with most medications, the carbon needs to be taken out of the filter, and another thing that helps greatly is to increase the temperature of the water and keep the lights off.  This helps hasten the life cycle of the parasite. I hope this helps someone out there make an informed decision about Quick Cure, but after seeing such great improvement after only 5 hours, I am completely sold.

Maintaining a Ph of 7.0 was difficult but possible, but my snails had the white pitting and my guppy had fin rot that he contracted during the time when I was totally new to fish keeping and didn't understand how important it is to snails and guppies to keep the Ph at or above 7.0.I had finally got the situation under control.  My guppy's fins were regenerating and my snails had new shell growth that was healthy.Then I made the grave mistake of trying this product.  Aloe vera?  So what.  Looked like a stupid gimmick.  Since when do fish need aloe vera?  Do we need to pull them out of the tank and rub moisturizing cream on them too?  How about some Lubriderm?Anyway, shortly after switching to this product my Ph crashed to 6.0.  My guppy's fins started rotting and got worse than ever, and the healthy growth on my snails that survived me climbing the learning curve last Summer now have white calcified shell damage.  I don't even recognize the two I named just a few months ago!I was doing emergency water changes morning and evening just to keep the Ph at about 6.4.  (My tap water is totally soft, but comes out of the tap at PH of about 7.2).  My hands got raw and cracked because I was washing my hands so much after working with the tank so much.I asked myself what had changed when this started, and the only thing I came up with was switching to this aloe vera stress coat.  Then I looked up aloe vera juice on the Internet and found it has a Ph of 3.5 to 5.0 depending on where I looked.  Wow, I thought, maybe putting something with Ph that low in the tank could throw the whole Ph down quite a bit.I bought some Tetra brand stress coat and did a few more water changes (some cracks in hands bleeding now, maybe MY hands could use some aloe vera!!) and soon the Ph climbed back up to 6.8.I did two emergency salt dips for the guppy, whose fin rot had begun on his body too.  It looks like the rot has been halted.  The damage has been done to my snails.  Maybe once I get this under control I'll have time to just stare at the tank a while and figure out who is who again through all the shell damage.So, thanks API for putting my fish and snails through hell.  Brilliant idea mixing a super low Ph substance in with water conditioner.  Did you test this thoroughly before you put it into production?

I immediately began searching to figure out what had caused it and noticed not too long later that he was chewing on his tail and I panicked! I have my betta in a three gallon bowl and he has ornaments to play with and rest on so I wasn't sure how he could be bored (I do not have a filter so I figured it must be caused by boredom). Well after rearranging his tank a little it stopped and i have not noticed it since. I knew though that I needed to get him something to help his fins grow back. Stress coat had long been recommended as both a water conditioner and for fin regrowth so I purchased it along with stress zyme by API. As soon as I received it I did a 100% water change and scrubbed the bowl and then quadrupled the dose of this and allowed to permeate for several hours before adding my betta back to the bowl (I also added some stress zyme with it). After just one day (24 hours) WOW what a difference! Not only did his fin look much healthier but he had stopped biting, was much more active and responsive, and his colors were much brighter and he just seemed much happier! The water also looked much cleaner. Now a month later his fin is totally healed and this is the only water conditioner I use. It just seems to be so healthy and does wonders for him. If you want to do something nice for your fish use this product and no other!I also highly recommend you use this with stress zyme! Stress zyme adds beneficial bacteria to the aquarium and should be used at start up and with water changes. These products work so well together and will do amazing things for your aquarium.

Maintaining a Ph of 7.0 was difficult but possible, but my snails had the white pitting and my guppy had fin rot that he contracted during the time when I was totally new to fish keeping and didn't understand how important it is to snails and guppies to keep the Ph at or above 7.0.I had finally got the situation under control. My guppy's fins were regenerating and my snails had new shell growth that was healthy.Then I made the grave mistake of trying this product. Aloe vera? So what. Looked like a stupid gimmick. Since when do fish need aloe vera? Do we need to pull them out of the tank and rub moisturizing cream on them too? How about some Lubriderm?Anyway, shortly after switching to this product my Ph crashed to 6.0. My guppy's fins started rotting and got worse than ever, and the healthy growth on my snails that survived me climbing the learning curve last Summer now have white calcified shell damage. I don't even recognize the two I named just a few months ago!I was doing emergency water changes morning and evening just to keep the Ph at about 6.4. (My tap water is totally soft, but comes out of the tap at PH of about 7.2). My hands got raw and cracked because I was washing my hands so much after working with the tank so much.I asked myself what had changed when this started, and the only thing I came up with was switching to this aloe vera stress coat. Then I looked up aloe vera juice on the Internet and found it has a Ph of 3.5 to 5.0 depending on where I looked. Wow, I thought, maybe putting something with Ph that low in the tank could throw the whole Ph down quite a bit.I bought some Tetra brand stress coat and did a few more water changes (some cracks in hands bleeding now, maybe MY hands could use some aloe vera!!) and soon the Ph climbed back up to 6.8.I did two emergency salt dips for the guppy, whose fin rot had begun on his body too. It looks like the rot has been halted. The damage has been done to my snails. Maybe once I get this under control I'll have time to just stare at the tank a while and figure out who is who again through all the shell damage.So, thanks API for putting my fish and snails through hell. Brilliant idea mixing a super low Ph substance in with water conditioner. Did you test this thoroughly before you put it into production?

Don't rely on the less-accurate and expensive test strips (one of my local big-name pet stores charges $15 for a pack of like 7 test strips.)The container for the test kit is pretty sturdy, for what it is. The tray is a bit thin and you will poke a hole through it if you are too rough. But the plastic top is much thicker.The bottles inside all fit neatly on the tray, as do the test tubes.The color chart is water-proof, and one piece, so no keeping up with multiple cards.Read the instructions. The Nitrate test requires shaking the #2 bottle for 30 seconds, and shaking the test tube for 1 minute. Otherwise your test results will be inaccurate. Also, don't hold your finger over the tube's cap as you shake, as the instructions warn you not to do, doing so may result in inaccurate results. Be careful with the Ammonia test. The first liquid is thick, and you will have to squeeze the bottle a bit to get it out. The second one is as thin as water, and if you squeeze it just as hard, it's going to put out way more than you need for the test, and it will ruin the test, and you will have to start over, and waste chemicals.Don't lose the test tubes. Replacements from API cost $2 each, or $24 for a box of 12. It might be cheaper going with generic glass 10ml tubes. I have read over time the plastic caps will slightly stretch, and not be completely water-tight anymore. At this point you might be better off finding generic 5ml test tube caps instead of ordering brand new test tubes from API.Be very careful of some of the chemicals. The irritant and corrosive warnings on some of the bottles aren't a joke. I had poured a couple test tubes out in a large jar of water, and figured I could dip the tube into the top to rinse out, and pour back into the jar. Just the few moments in the diluted water, and my thumb tingled and slightly burned.If there could be any improvements in the kit, it would be to include a dropper and maybe a small collection bottle for your aquarium water. You really shouldn't dip the tubes into the water, as any residue left in them will get into your tank. Some of these chemicals are bad-news for fish, and can straight-up kill them. I also wish the test chart had slightly more white space between color graphs, as you are supposed to place the test tubes against it to measure the color. The test tubes are slightly wider than the white space, so it's a little harder to judge accurate color unless you are in bright light.This kit is also designed to detect a certain kind of Ammonia, not straight Ammonia out of a bottle. So if you are doing a fishless cycle on your tank with Ammonia, it will not detect it correctly. It will report far less than is actually in the tank, and you will end up overdosing your tank if you rely on it. There are other test kits on the market that will accurately detect Ammonia like this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "API Freshwater Master Test Kit", "unixReviewTime": 1388707200, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014"}

It contains all the must know tests to ensure your water quality is up to par for your tropical fish. The importance of a kit like this really shines while you are cycling a tank and it's critical you know how the cycle is progressing. A liquid test kit like this one is far more accurate than using strips, and is cheaper in the long run.A brand new aquarium will experience what is called a cycle. Fish produce waste in the form of Ammonia, which is pretty toxic to the fish and has long term health effects, and possibly death. Bacteria that naturally exists everywhere in the air will enter the tank and feed off the ammonia. The bacteria produce Nitrite as a waste and unfortunately this is even more toxic to fish than the original ammonia was. However, again, there is a natural bacteria in the air that will enter the tank and consume the Nitrite, and in the process produce Nitrate (with an a). Nitrate, again, is toxic to fish but they can tolerate it far better than ammonia or nitrite.A tank is fully cycled when both Ammonia and Nitrite (with an i) are 0 ppm and you have some reading of Nitrate (with an a).And this is why this test kit comes in handy, it contains tests for Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, pH, and high range pH. You'll likely only use one or the other for pH depending on what your tap water is (acidic or basic).All of the tests are easy to perform, and the kit comes with 4 test tubes allowing you to perform all of the needed tests at once. A word of caution, follow the directions closely for the Nitrate test, it requires you to shake the #2 reagent bottle for a period of time. This is essential for an accurate reading.CAUTION: If you use a water conditioner that will also detoxify ammonia (for example Seachem Prime), this test kit will still show an Ammonia reading. This is because the conditioner converts the Ammonia to Ammonium, a chemical that still contains the Ammonia but in a non-toxic form to fish.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A must have for any freshwater aquarium", "unixReviewTime": 1327968000, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2012"}

It is pretty inexpensive ($20 cheaper here than at my local pet store, and certainly more cost effective than buying test strips), seems to be accurate, and provides all the tests the average tank owner would need. The tests are easy to perform and it only takes a few minutes to complete (btw, regarding other reviewers' complaints about how long it took - if you don't have ~5 minutes to spare in your week you probably shouldn't be keeping fish).I originally bought this kit while doing a fishless cycle and was having serious questions about the accuracy of the dipstick tests I'd bought first. I felt much more comfortable with the results I got using the tube method. With the strips I had a hard time reading the results for nitrites and nitrates, it was much easier with this kit.I typically only use the nitrate test now to ensure I'm keeping up with my water changes, however I do periodically check the pH, ammonia, and nitrite just to make sure that nothing weird is going on. I'll use a medicine dropper I bought from the dollar store to fill the test tubes and perform all 4 tests at once (depending on the pH of your water, you only need to do either the normal pH or high pH, not both, so 4 tubes is sufficient).The ammonia and nitrate tests can be a little messy as water can seep around the cap, so I use cling wrap or parafilm, making sure to keep one finger over the open end just in case. It's best to read the test in a brightly lit room under white light; I check it under the fluorescent lights in the kitchen. They're all easy enough to read, and even if you can't find an EXACT match to a color on the chart, you'll get a pretty good idea of what your levels are.I do wish a hardness test was included, but for the average person it isn't really needed.

Seems a bit much, no?  That being said, this process isn't any more difficult than any other system I've seen, and it seems to be accurate.

Be aware that the test tubes are glass and will occasionally shatter when trying to juggle all 4 at once, but I've only once needed to test for everything - the first day the kit came in.  Nitrates are probably the only regular (weekly) test you'll have to do outside of changes to the tank, such as adding fish or changing substrate or filter media.FYI each bottle has a printed \"Lot Number\" on the back, the last four digits of which are the month and year of manufacture.

But rather, to enable you to get a decent reading of say, where your PH level is knowing the accuracy may be off a few points sure beats shelling out $200 for a good digital PH meter.It's critical to understand these limitations and that they apply to everyone of the four included tests.PHHigh Range PHAmmoniaNitritesNitratesFor must of us, Ammonia is the most important because it's the number one killer of aquarium kept fish. The others are important of course, but Ammonia levels should always be checked and checked often. It's also important to pay attention to the expiration dates of the liquid reagents. Expired reagents mean off the charts inaccurate readings. Along with the liquid reagents the kit includes, instructions both in a small manual and attached to each bottle of testing liquid, four test tube, four plastic caps and a color chart.To ensure you get the most accurate reading possible compare the finished result to the card color block in the best possible light and against the most pure white background you can find. Just like computer monitors many of us see color differently which is the inherent draw back of this type of testing. But again, there is nothing else on the market at this kind of price point which can give you enough information to correct and adjust your key water parameters.If you're just starting out in this wonderful hobby, you'll master using this kit in no time and it will help you maintain a healthy and flourishing aquarium. Remember to never, ever rinse even cleaned test tubes in your tank water - even very small traces of testing reagents can be lethal to your fish.Draw water from your tank using a large plastic syringe available at any drug store, super market, or add one to cart from Amazon.For a full range of tests that cover the four most significant parameters you need to stay on top of - you can't beat the API Master test kits, not at this price.

The old way was to siphon water out into a bucket, which was dumped down the sink, commode, or in the yard. The bucket was then refilled and poured back into the tank.To change water in this manner was a little bit labor intensive on a small tank, and really time consuming on a larger tank.I stumbled on my pump in a Thrift store, where I found it on a shelf for $1. In all honesty, I'm not 100% sure mine is a Python brand, as there is no name on it. It may actually be a knock-off. Mine is made of blue plastic, not green, but otherwise looks identical to the item pictured.It operates by connecting it to a water supply with a fitting at the top in the photo. Water flows through from top to bottom, past a venturi located where the side fitting is, creating a suction which will draw water out of the aquarium through a hose. I purchased 50 feet of clear vinyl hose from my local aquarium store, attached it to this device, and put a suction strainer on the other end to avoid sucking small fish into the hose.In use, I drop the suction strainer into the tank, unroll the hose, and attach the pump to the water tap outside my front door. Opening the diverter on the pump outlet, then turning on the water tap starts a siphon which removes as much water from my tank as I desire (water tap can be closed once siphon starts so long as the pump is lower than the tank, siphon will continue).Closing the diverter on the pump outlet stops the siphon, and opening the water tap with the diverter closed refills the tank.I can't imagine any way to make water changes any easier. I've been using this device for years now, and it still works great.There are adapters available which allow the user to connect the pump to their kitchen or washroom sink instead of outside the house, if the aquarium is located closer to those water sources. There are also attachments which allow you to vacuum the gravel with the water siphoning out of the tank, if you feel the need to perform this task (I never vacuum because I don't use an undergravel filter, because I use EcoComplete substrate, and because I have fish which eat any food which falls to the bottom, so for me, the need simply isn't there).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Aquarium Water Changes Made Easy", "unixReviewTime": 1255564800, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2009"}

In the \"old\" days, I remember (not so fondly) siphoning water into buckets and hauling them through the house to do water changes.  Anyone who's ever done water changes this way - even in smaller tanks - well remembers what a pain and mess it is.However, I was a little skeptical that this product would work.  My tank actually sits slightly below the level of the sink I intended to use.  Also, as it's a bathroom faucet, it has internal threads and so I wasn't completely certain this would screw on to it and work.  However, it screwed on easily once the aerator was removed and worked like a charm.  The height difference didn't effect the siphoning at all and I managed to do a 50% water change on a 30-gallon tank in less than 15 minutes.  That alone makes this worth the money.  Add to it that I simply rotate the valve and start filling the tank back up without losing a single drop of water and I will never again do a bucket water change.My only concern with this is the plastic fittings on the faucet adapter.  It has a brass fitting that screws directly into the faucet, but the rest is hard plastic which will require care to keep from cracking.  However, this does not need to be tightened any more than simply hand-tightening.

Then a piece broke. I contacted their CS and was sent a new piece. That piece broke the first time I used it. :(In comes the Python system like a knight in shining armor!! I love that I can clean my fish tank all by myself. The hook up to my kitchen sink is virtually idiot proof. (I say &#34;virtually&#34; because I still don't get why I am turning the connector to the left to tighten it... &#34;righty tighty&#34;.)  Anyhow. I put the instructions in a plastic page protector so that I can keep them in good condition in the storage cabinet under my tank. After I have everything connected to the faucet, I place a plastic handle bag over the faucet and connection, with the handles hanging down into the sink. This keeps all of that fish dirt water from splashing around.I love that I can fill the tank with clean water using the same contraption. When I start filling the water, I put in the water conditioner (Prime, I think). I multi-tasked today while filling the tank by using my algae brush on the sides of the tank. The fish and snails look pretty darn happy in their clean tank. I think I'm going to get the 10' extension hose though. I can reach almost to the far end of the tank but I don't want to risk damaging the connection with the on/off switch or the faucet connector, etc., by pulling on the hose. I think the 10' extension is a little overkill, I really only need about 5' - but I'd rather have too much than what I have right now.  I really like that the hose is soft and flexible and stays that way. It's so easy to roll it all up for storage.I wish I would have gone with this brand when I first bought the other cleaning system.

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here's the nutritional analysis:-100% freeze dried liver-NO additives or preservatives.-Crude protein..... not less than 50%-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%-Moisture.....  not more than 6%", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "best dog treat-- great for training---  all dogs love them", "unixReviewTime": 1233360000, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2009"}

I get more excitement from her when I use Zuke's mini naturals, but maybe my corgi will readjust once she's been treated with the dried liver a couple more times.The biggest problem I have with this product is the size. The cubes are inconsistently cut (as another reviewer notes, to which I did not pay enough attention to until I ran into the problem myself). The larger cubes are very difficult for small dogs (my corgi is about 8 months old) and puppies to eat with ease, which is necessary especially for training. She just kind of licks at it until it becomes small enough for her to fit in her mouth. I have to chop them up, which is actually difficult because they are so brittle that they chip into strange shapes and leave a lot of dust behind on my kitchen counter.Again, this was advertised to me as the holy grail of dog treats and I was disappointed when it fell short of this lofty claim. However, if you have a much larger dog than I, it is very conceivable that he/she could swallow these blocks whole.

It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training).

Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool.

Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces.

Most experienced fish keepers keep it at least 5. When dkh gets below 3 a dangerous condition is produced that will likely kill fish. Over time the dkh will fall in your aquarium due to the acids produced in your filter. Water changes or adding an appropriate buffer should be done when the KH falls below a target level.PH is controlled by 3 factors, KH, CO2 and the amount of acid produced in your filter.My tap water has a dkh of 8, I am setting up a tank for a Dwarf puffer. I found these fish do not acclimatize as well as most acid loving fish. This prompted me to experiment with the Neutral regulatorAfter adding a good amount over a period of 3 days I saw little change, I concluded that it is not really great at lowering PH.Next I started with a new batch of tap water and used Acid Buffer to lower my dkh to about 1. I then added some Neutral Regulator and tested my water the next day, The PH was about 7 and the dkh was 6.If your tap water has low dkh it is likely to be low in trace minerals, or If you use RO or distilled water it will lack trace minerals need for fish. In this case you can use an alkaline buffer (commercial or baking soda) or the neutral regulator to raise the KH. You will also need to add trace minerals which will raise the GH.It is important when doing a water change to not make drastic changes in your tank, A change of over .3 ph, more then 2dkh or a change temperature more then 2 degrees F can cause problems.In conclusion I found the best way for me to use this product was to add acid buffer to drop my dkh to around 1 then use the Neutral regulator to make the water stable.What you need to add to your water, if anything, depends on state of your tap water.

Please keep in mind that a phosphate based buffer can cause algae growth if planted aquariums. My aquarium is planted, but with plants that do well in low light.

Gamez \"Cheddar323\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I've been using Prime for quite a while now and it seems to be working out for me. When I first started out with my tanks I was using \"Jungle\" water conditioner and it seemed to do it's job but I wanted something more \"top of the line\" if you will. I didn't make the switch because I thought the \"Jungle\" product was inferior but I just wanted the \"best\" for my fish. I started researching about the best water conditioner and everyone kept raving about \"Prime\" they would talk about how affordable it was and the benefits that came from using this product. It seemed like the best choice for me so I made the switch I did notice that the stuff is very strong and concentrated so it doesn't take much to treat your water. As far as dosing Prime you just need to follow the instructions on the back of the bottle. I'm usually careful when I dose with Prime because of it's potency so when I prepare my water in a 5 gallon bucket I usually dose 2 drops per gallon. The reason I do it this way is because I don't want to overdose on Prime I rather be safe than sorry. With that said when I first started dosing with Prime I would dose it straight into the bucket of water. Then I would siphon the water into my tank without letting the water age. I started noticing that every time after I did a water change my fish would start gulping for air at the surface. I started reading certain threads and some people stated that in some cases too much Prime can cause oxygen depletion. Seachem has stated that you can overdose Prime about 5x the recommended dosage and it still would be safe for fish. I personally wouldn't take the risk especially if you don't have proper aeration in your tank. I know most people will say that it doesn't matter if you let your water age or if you wait for the water conditioner to take effect (since it works instantly) and they might be right but in my situation it seems to make a difference. I let my water age for about 24 hours and I sometimes even dose the water before letting it age. I also give the water a little stir just to make sure everything is mixed up well I'm not sure if it helps but I do it regardless. I've noticed that after doing all of the above my fish don't gasp for air anymore and they don't seem to be bothered at all by weekly water changes. The only downside to my method would be that the agents that lock down ammonia, nitrites and nitrates to something less toxic wouldn't really be taking effect. These locking agents stop working after 24 hours or 48 hours depending on how much you dose. I'm not too worried about it though because I keep my tanks fairly clean and I methodically keep up with my water changes. Be warned that Prime does not get rid of ammonia, nitrites or nitrates for good it just converts it to something less toxic which then allows your biological filtration to clean it up for a short period of time. Like I stated before Prime only takes effect for a brief moment and once it stops working the toxins that were locked down are released back into your water. That's where regular water changes come into play having clean water and using Prime in conjunction will definitely work to your advantage. I would say that in laymen terms Prime is a good water dechlorinator that happens to come with a few extra's. Would I say it's worth making the switch? I wouldn't really be able to answer that question because there are a lot of great products out in the market that work similar if not the same as Prime. I would however say that from a personal stand point Prime is a great product and it works very well and if used correctly it can be very effective and affordable at the same time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Seachem Prime", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2013"}

Ammonia 0, Nitrates, 0, Nitrates under 10ppm.  That is almost a complete 360!  My fish are happy, my plants are happy, I am happy.Please note, when I bought this I also changed from AquaSafe to Prime.  Purigen will need to be recharged every couple of months.  Using bleach then Prime.  I also added Prime to my Goldfish tank when switching to Purigen.  Both are made by Seachem.  I can not say 100% if it was my just using the Purigen or if it was the two together that changed my tank.  I highly suggest both in unison.  Now using in my nano with the same results.

Getting most of the popular and widely available aquatic plants to grow in a fish tank with sufficient lighting is not very hard.  What is a challenge is getting the plants to grow at a rate fast enough to be able to keep algae under control.  Under the care of an inexperienced aquarists, what starts out at as tank full of lush, green plants quickly turn into an algae farm.  Soon after, algae takes over.  The aquarists takes measures to fight the algae, and more often than not, loses the battle.Is it really necessary to add a substrate fertilizer to a planted tank?  Would it not be much easier to simply dose with a liquid fertilizer on a regular basis?  The answers to those questions would depend on the plants, and your specific situation.  All I can provide here are some advise, based on personal experience as well as information learned from other hobbyists.It is not entirely correct to assume that you cannot fertilize the roots without the use of a substrate fertilizer.  When you add liquid fertilizer to the water, eventually, that fertilizer will work its way down into the substrate.  Anything you put in the water will also make it down into the substrate.  In most cases, a substrate fertilizer like this Flourish Tabs is not necessary if you already add liquid fertilizer.  The principle also works in both directions.  When you add a solid fertilizer to the substrate, eventually it will dissolve and make its way to the water column.There are some specific situations in which using a solid, substrate fertilizer will have an advantage.  For my situation, I wanted to fertilize the plants growing on the substrate, but avoid fertilizing the floating plants.  That is not entirely possible, but with root tabs, you can deliver the ingredients to the plant roots before they make it up to the floating plants.  In other words, the ingredients will be at a higher concentration down in the substrate, while it is slowly diffusing into the water column.  Theoretically, you are encouraging the growth of the rooted plants more aggressively than you are encouraging the growth of the floating plants.  Theoretically, you are also keeping algae under control by avoiding dumping a high concentration of fertilizer in the water.  This is theoretical since we know that algae can do quite well with just a small amount of fertilizer.What is a clear advantage is that a solid, substrate fertilizer is low maintenance.  You can add these tablets to the substrate and not have to worry about adding liquid fertilizer on a frequent basis.  The solid tabs can last a long time and the effects continue even after it has dissolved.  The ingredients will slowly migrate upwards into the water, but not before the roots of the plants have had a chance to use up their share.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A solid product from Seachem!", "unixReviewTime": 1403568000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2014"}

When my box arrived, I had this product in the box in stead.  Not sure what happened in the mix up, but I ended up holding on to this product.  This review is neutral and does not reflect the fact that the mix-up happened.Considering the volume of the container I got for the price, this is more than a good deal for a chlorine treatment.  I usually use API Stress-coat, which, according to both bottles, should offer the same features.  I gave this one a try one week during my regular water changes, and my fish seemed to behave normally.  Nothing wrong with it.  The item came as it is packaged in stores, with no signs of defects.  It is a water dechlorinator for aquariums.  That's what the bottle says, and that's what it does.  No complaints.I have one big problem with all of Tetra's products, and that is that these bottles are NOT SEALED at the top.  It's a goopy liquid I'm supposed to pour into my aquarium.  I am not qualified to determine whether what's in the bottle is what the bottle says it has in it.  When I get API products, they come with a seal on top.  This one, there's no telling if what I'm buying is what's in the bottle.  Since this is an online order there's less risk, but I completely avoid Tetra products in stores because they're open containers.  Do I know whether the employees thought mixing them around would be funny?  Or if someone opened one up and got something in the bottle?  NO!

You get a huge bottle for little money.You'll run accross brands such as Kent Marine and Seachem, that claim to do wonders, but at a much higher price.

The bottle's cap has measuring engravings on its top side,so you don't have to worry about how much to add. I always use a bit more, because the water in my city is a bit too harsh for fish.This is a great, affordable product that works perfectly to neutralize chlorine, chloromines and other heavy metals.A WORD OF WARNING:This product can be extremely harmful to household pets.

I like that the bottle has a squeeze top and a cap, has a narrow profile, and adds both slime coat additive and dechlorinator/heavy metal neutralizer. The product also eliminates chloramines.Since chlorine and chloramine are both broken down with one tool, it's a superior product over the NovAqua Water Conditioner (but only if you have chloramines to deal with - you need to check with your local water provider).With NovAqua you have the benefit of a product that adds beneficial water electrolytes, but nothing to cover chloramines, unless you also purchase the sister-product of Amquel. Remember, you want to add as few additives to your aquarium as you can safely manage, to decrease the overall ion load on your fishes' gills.The narrow profile of the bottle means I can easily store the bottle among my fish stuff. It slides in really easily on my shelf of fish paraphenalia. It's a nice break from all those round bottles that leave a lot of space unused. It's also more ergonomic, squeeze-wise.With the squeeze top, I can choose to add actual drops for small tanks or use the cap as a cup measure for larger tanks. This takes care of a problem many conditioners have that are either established for tiny tanks (ie - under five gallons...where you should only add a drop per gallon), and for larger tanks, where you need a teaspoon for every 10 gallons. So this one product can service those one gallon betta tanks from the squeeze top and those 50 gallon tanks from the cap. There are also equal measure marks on the side of the container for making up really big batches of dechlorinated water. Each raised measure equals 10ml, or 20 gallons. Anyway, I like that this container makes my life easier.It would be an even better product if the inside of the cap was marked for each teaspoon amount (one gallon amount). As it is, I only needed to measure out a teaspoon the first time, poured that into the cap, and then marked that amount with a sharpie for future use.In summary, if you have chloramines in your tap water, this is the product to get for conditioning your aquarium water. If you do not have chloramines, then I suggest the NovAqua Water Conditioner (to add electrolytes) instead.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "If you have chloramines in your tap water, this is the water conditioner to get", "unixReviewTime": 1215216000, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2008"}

The fact that they can operate for several years before needing to be replaced is a testament to their overall construction.The Aquaclear series of filters utilize a magnetic impeller assembly with the plastic fan attached to the top of the unit.The Aquaclear 20, 30, 50 and 70 all use the same electric motor and  magnetic impeller assembly, the only difference being that the fan attachment for each subsequent filter is slightly larger  than its smaller sibling, thusallowing the next size up Aquaclear to pass a greater number of gallons of water per hour.This also gives you some flexiblity in how these  filters can be used.  For instance, suppose you would like to be able to increase the amount of time between filter cleanings, while maintaining the same water flow that you have with an Aquaclear 50.You can purchase an Aquaclear 70 and swap out its impeller for the one in the Aquaclear 50. This way you have a greater filter surface area, without increasing the turbulence of your aquarium's water.The Aquaclear filters do have an adjustable water flow, however, even at the lowest level, an Aquaclear 70 would be too powerful for say a 10 gallon aquarium.However, with the impeller blade from  an Aquaclear 30, installed in an Aquaclear 70, you get the advantage of far greater filter area than the 30, which leads to less frequent cleanings, and you won't have to worry about your fish having to fight the current of the Aquaclear 70's larger impeller fan.Later on, should you decide to move up to a larger sized aquarium, you can then install the impeller that your Aquaclear 70 came with.This flexiblity is just one of the advantages that  four of the Aquaclear filters (20, 30, 50 & 70) offer, since they utilize the same electric motor; the only difference being the size of the plastic fans which come attached to the magnetic impellers.There is a reason why the Aquaclear line of hob filters have lasted virtually unchanged for the past 25 years and have a very loyal customer base.An extremely clever design with flexibility in mind.And as a fishkeeper, you need all the flexibility you can get.The Aquaclear's ability to swap out impeller fans, as well as to use a number of different permutations regarding filter media, makes these filters the most cleverly designed on the market.And the fact that they are also workhorses only adds to the satisfaction of owning them, since they do an excellent job of cleaning an aquarium, even though like most aquarium filter manufacturers, their rating tends to be optimistic.For example,  if you are buying a 30 gallon tank, pass on the Aquaclear 30 and get the 50, since it will do a better job of filtering your tank - especially if it's overstocked and heavily planted.This author enthusiastically recommends the Aquaclear line of hob filters.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "What Can You Say About An Aquarium Filter's Impeller?", "unixReviewTime": 1327536000, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2012"}
